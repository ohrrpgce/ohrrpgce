This is a list of attack bitsets. {{edit_bitsets}}

Turning on any of these bits causes the attack to do elemental damage, which may result in more or less damage depending on how much damage the target takes from that element; see the "Elemental Resistances" submenu in the Hero and Enemy editors.

Multiple elemental bitsets can be combined: the damages are multiplied. For example if an attack is set to do 'Fire', 'Light', and 'Holy' damage, from which the target takes, respectively, 200%, -150% and -100% damage, then the attack will do 200% * 150% * 100% * -1 = -300% damage. That is, the target will be healed by triple the amount of damage which the attack would otherwise do.

Elemental damage is also very useful for special effects: enemies may spawn or counter-attack in response to being hit by an elemental attack.
You can mark certain elements as "non-elemental", in General Game Settings->Battle System Options. An attack is non-elemental if it doesn't do damage of any element, except for non-elemental ones. Each non-elemental can have its own counterattack, and you can also set a general counterattack against non-elemental attacks.
