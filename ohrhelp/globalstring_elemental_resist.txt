Unlike other global text strings, this one may contain tags which are replaced with other text in-game, similar to tags in textboxes.

This string is used on the second screen of the Status menu, for each element from which a hero takes less or more damage than the normal 100%. The available tags are:

$E - The name of the element.
$D - The percentage of normal damage
     taken from this element.
$X - Equal to $D - 100%. That is, the
     damage taken above normal.
$R - Equal to 100% - $D. The amount
     of reduction from normal damage.
$A - Equal to -$D. The amount
     absorbed.

For example,
'$E: $D $X $R $A' could become
'Fire: -20% -120% 120% 20%'
