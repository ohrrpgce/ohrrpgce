This is the NPC picker. Here you can select from the available NPCs for the current map. You will see a preview of each NPC's picture plus the first line of text from any text box that is attached to the NPC.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) or type in an ID to navigate the menu.

Press ENTER or SPACE to choose an NPC definition to edit.

Press CTRL+C to copy an NPC definition, and CTRL+V to paste it, overwriting the selected NPC. You can paste it to a different map. Be careful, there's no undo!

Press DELETE to delete all the copies of an NPC that are on the map, and/or the NPC definition itself.

Press INSERT or + to quickly add a new NPC.

Press ESC to go back to the previous menu.
