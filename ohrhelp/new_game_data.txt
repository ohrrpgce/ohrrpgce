This is the New Game Data Editor.

Navigate with the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End), or type part of a menu item to jump to it.

Type in numbers for the various data that will be used when the player starts a new game.

The initial X,Y and map number can also be set in the map editor (press Ctrl+H to set the starting location.)

Starting Textbox causes a textbox to appear when you start a new game, in addition to running the new-game script.
