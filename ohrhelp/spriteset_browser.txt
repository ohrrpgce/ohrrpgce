This is the spriteset browser and editor, which shows all the spritesets of one type and lets you edit or add then. Each box is a sprite set. Different types of sprites have different default sizes and different numbers of frames in each set.

Use the arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) or mousewheel to navigate, or type in a spriteset number to jump to it.

Select the box at the front of a spriteset that says "Set #" in order to do an operation on a whole spriteset, such as copying, pasting, importing, exporting, resizing, or drawing the whole spriteset at once (useful for replacing colors or shifting all frames).

Press ENTER, SPACE or CLICK to start editing a single frame sprite or the whole spriteset.

Press ESC to go back to the main graphics menu.

If you want to add a new spriteset, select "Add new spriteset" at the bottom.

You can change the default palette for a sprite set using the [ and ] keys.

CTRL+C copies a sprite or spriteset.
CTRL+V pastes a sprite or spriteset.
CTRL+T pastes a sprite or spriteset using color 0 as transparent.
Select "Set #" and hit CTRL+C/V/T to copy/paste the whole spriteset.
Copying and pasting works between different spriteset types.

Press E to export the currently selected frame or spriteset to a BMP file.
Press I to import a frame or spriteset from a BMP, PNG or JPEG file, overwriting the currently selected one. You can import from an image of any size. It will be cropped/expanded to the expected size.
