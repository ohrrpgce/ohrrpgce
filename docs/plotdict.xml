DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS XML FILE:

This markup (hereby refered to as PDL (Plotscript Dictionary Language)) is
designed to reduce the time spent maintaining the Plotscripting Dictionary, and
to enable easier porting to other formats.

The root element is the <plotscript> element. It has a 'version' attribute,
the engine version it applies to. Update this when releasing.

In <plotscript>, there is a series of <section> elements, each with a title
attribute. These are to group the plotscripting commands into logical groups,
such as <section title="Wait Commands"> or <section title="Math Operators">.
Sections can be nested inside each other. And commands that appear after
a subsection will be reorderd in front of all subsections.

The heart of the PDL are the <command> elements inside the <section>s. It has a
single attribute, id. This is essentially the whitespace stripped version of the
command (the "wait for text box" command would have an id of "waitfortextbox").
This is used to uniquely identify each command. It's used in many ways, from
crosslinking command entries to generating a file for HssEd to use.

Inside the <command> element are subelements, in this order:
Case 1: Full command definition
  <canon>*      - This is the "canonical" form of the command: the fully spaced
                  command with parameter prototypes. Can appear multiple times to
		  show alternative arg lists; only the first is shown in command
		  indexes. (Use <altcommand> instead for aliases). Example:
		  <canon>import globals (slot, first, last)</canon>
                  <canon>import globals (slot, id)</canon>
  <shortname>   - This is the short version of the command, used for crosslinking,
                  indexes, etc. It is the <canon> element, minus the parameters.
                  Example: import globals
  <altcommand>* - This defines an alias to the command which is documented
                  together with it, but which appears separately in command
		  indexes (if it contains a <canon>) and can be linked to
		  separately. Must have an id="" attribute and <shortname>
		  subelement, and usually has one or more <canon>s. If there's no
		  canon then <shortname> is used for links but no 'canon' line
		  appears in the command definition.
		  "Alias:" is displayed before the command, unless you add
		  alias="hide".
  <added>       - Version this was added in. Not used!
  <deprecated>  - Version this was deprecated in. Not used!
  <description> - This is a paragraph (or more) of text describing what the
                  command does, and how to use it. Use <lb/> to put paragraphs
                  in, and <p></p> when referring to a parameter (to avoid user
                  confusion). No HTML is allowed (at this time).
                  You can also embed <example> blocks inside <description> blocks
                  instead of having them trail afterwards. Example: Well, it
                  would be pretty long...
  <example>*    - Finally, commands may  have some sort of example usage of the
                  the command. You can put this inside <description> instead;
		  that way you can put more text after/between the example(s).
                  It will be displayed in a mono-space font suitable for code.
                  But, be sure to format it properly:
                  Example:
                  <example># first example line has no line-break
# the second (and more) lines should have no indentation
# and so forth</example>

As an alternative to <altcommand> you can also define aliases which have
separate entries. This is probably mainly useful for obsolete aliases which
you want to hide in a different section:

Case 2: Alias command definition
  <alias>       - If a command is an alias to another command (or is so closely
                  related that they're in the same entry, use the <alias> element. Put
                  the ID of the real command in here. Example: begin
  <shortname>   - Aliases also need a short name, since they are technically
                  different from their alias. Example: end

Additionally, if you want a command to appear in multiple sections,
define it once and place references to it elsewhere.
  <reference>   - Has a single attribute, 'ref', and no contents.

Basically, you should be able to examine the entries that already exist. It's
fairly self evident what everything does.

If you have xmllint installed you can run update-html.sh and it'll tell you
about all kinds of critical errors that your web browser will probably silently
ignore by throwing away what it doesn't understand.


These are cut-and-paste copies of <command> elements, so you don't have to type
everything out 10000000000 times. They are also indented properly for this file.

Which reminds me: Indentation. For each "level" you go down in the hierarchy,
you indent once. Many code specific editors will maintain this indentation level
for until you explicitly change it, so it isn't difficult. Notepad users will
have to do it manually, but you MUST do it. Remember: 1 indent = 1 tab.
(However, subsections are not indented, in order to keep all commands at the
same level.)

			<description>
				The plotscript command contains a list of commands that can be triggered directly by an event in your game.
				<lb/>
				Plotscript starts with the keyword plotscript, a comma, and then the name of the plotscript.
				If there are any arguments to the script, you list their names separated by commas after the name of
				the script, optionally with default values declared like <tt>arg = defaultvalue</tt>.
				<lb/>
				Then comes the text of the script.
				It is enclosed in <ref>begin</ref> and <ref>end</ref> statements.
				Scripts that are defined as plotscripts can be called directly from "trigger" events in your game,
				or by name within other scripts.
				<note>
					What's the difference between <p>plotscript</p> and <ref>script</ref>?
					<lb/>
					The only difference is that plotscripts are listed in the game editor,
					allowing them to be attached to triggers
					(such as the new-game script),
					while plain <tt>script</tt>s are hidden and can't be selected.
					(Technically you can use a <tt>script</tt> as a trigger,
					but only by using a command like <ref>setdeathscript</ref>.)

			<description><p>subscript</p> is just like <ref>script</ref> except that it must placed inside another script (or even inside another subscript). See <ref>script</ref> for details of syntax of arguments. The difference from a regular script is that a subscript can only be called from its parent script (or some other subscript), and it can directly access its parent script's variables in addition to its own arguments and variables. Subscripts can be useful when you have some piece of repeated code that you want to "de-duplicate" by moving into another script which you can call repeatedly, but without having to turn local variables into global variables.</description>
			<example># Some nearby NPCs move into a line to the north of the hero
plotscript, line up soldiers, begin
	show textbox(32)  # "Yes sir!"
	wait for textbox
	suspend player
	set hero direction(me, up)
	variable (x, y)
	# The position of the start of the line
	x := hero X(me) -- 2
	y := hero Y(me) -- 4
	subscript, line up NPC, npc, begin
		# Increment X to get next position in the line
		x += 1
		walk NPC to X(npc, x)
		wait for NPC(npc)
		walk NPC to Y(npc, y)
		wait for NPC(npc)
		set NPC direction(npc, down)
	end
	# NPCs move one at a time
	line up NPC(1)
	line up NPC(3)
	line up NPC(11)
	line up NPC(10)
	line up NPC(5)
	resume player
end</example>
		</command>
		<command id="globalvariable">
			<canon>global variable (id,name)</canon>
			<shortname>global variable</shortname>
			<description>Creates a global variable that can be used in any script. The first argument to the global variable declaration is a unique ID number. The second argument is the name of the variable. The ID number for a global variable is a number from 0 to 16383. Each global variable must have a unique number, but this number will not conflict with the ID numbers you use for scripts. It is all right to have a script and a global variable with the same ID number. See also <ref>variable</ref></description>

			<description>Creates a local variable that can only be used inside the script where it was created. The value of this variable is lost when the script ends. If you need a variable who&apos;s value persists between calls to a script, or that is automatically saved when the player saves their game, you will need to use a <ref>globalvariable</ref> instead.</description>

		<command id="include">
			<canon>include, filename</canon>
			<shortname>include</shortname>
			<description>The include command effectively inserts another text file into your script. It is followed by a single filename that tells what file will be included. This can be used to organise your scripts and other definitions like <ref>defineconstant</ref> into multiple files. The filename can include a path, for example <p>include, ..\utility scripts\math.hss</p>. You can optionally include quote marks around the filename, e.g. <p>include, "misc.hss"</p>, which causes normal string parsing (for example, allowing a # character in a filename). <lb/>Previously every plotscript file had to start with <p>include, plotscr.hsd</p> but this is now optional. <p>plotscr.hsd</p>, <p>scancode.hsi</p>, and the exported <p>your game name.hsi</p> file are all automatically included.</description>

				<tt>begin</tt> is a synonym for <tt>(</tt> and <tt>end</tt> is a synonym for <tt>)</tt>.

				For example, the following:
				<example>if (check tag(tag:have rusty sword)) then (show text box (5), wait for text box)</example>

			<description>The <p>if</p> statement checks the value of its condition, and if the value is <ref>true</ref> (actually, any value other than <ref>false</ref> (which is zero) counts as true), it runs the commands in the <p>then</p> block. If the value is <ref>false</ref>, it runs the commands in its <p>else</p> block. The conditional is usually a comparison operator such as <ref>equal</ref> or <ref>notequal</ref>, or a command which returns either true or false, such as <ref>checktag</ref>. The <p>else</p> is optional as long as you have a <p>then</p>, and the <p>then</p> is optional as long as you have an <p>else</p>. You can also place one or more <ref>elseif</ref>s after the <p>then</p> (or immediately after the <p>if</p> if you skip the <p>then</p>) instead of nesting multiple <p>if</p> statements.</description>

			<shortname>for</shortname>
			<description>The for command runs the commands in the do block a specified number of times. The first argument to for is the counter. It must be a variable. The next two arguments are the starting value and the finishing value. For example, if you use a start value of 1 and a finish value of 10 then the do block will run 10 times. The first time the do block runs, the counter will be 1, then it will be 2, then 3 and so on until it reaches 10, the finish value. The fourth argument of for is optional. It is the step by which the counter will change each loop. If you use a step of 2 then the counter will count 1,3,5,7,9. If you switch the start and finish values and use a step of -1 then the counter will go backwards. If you use 0 as the step, the counter will never change, so the do block will repeat forever. See <ref>return</ref> and <ref>puthero</ref> for examples.</description>

				<warn>
					<p>return</p> in HamsterSpeak is very different from <p>return</p> in nearly all other programming languages!
				</warn>
				Sets the value to be returned by the script.
				This is only useful when the script has been called as a function from another script.
				It is irrelevant to scripts called directly from your RPG,
				for example, text box scripts or menu scripts.
				This command only matters when you are calling one script from another script.
				This command does NOT cause the script to terminate, it just sets the return value.
				If you never use the <p>return</p> command, the script will return zero.
				If return is used more than once in the same script, only the last one executed matters.
<example>
script, key wait, ticks, begin
  # Returns true if a key was pressed during the wait,
  # or false (0) if the wait finished uninterrupted.
  # The wait duration is always the same. (Compare with the example for "exit returning".)
  variable(i)
  for(i, 1, ticks) do, begin
    wait(1)
    if(key is pressed(use key)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(menu key)) then(return(true))
  end
end

			<canon>switch(expression)</canon>
			<shortname>switch</shortname>
			<added>ubersetzung</added>
			<description>Select between a number of <ref>case</ref> blocks to execute based on the value of an expression. The switch command is an alternative to a big block of nested <ref>if</ref>/then/else commands that all check the same value. Switch can be easier to read than a lot of if's. Consider the follow script snippet:
<example>if (v == 0) then (
  something
) else if (v == 1 || v == 2) then (
  something else
) else if (v == 3 || v == 4) then (
  yet another thing
) else if (v == 10) then (
  #nothing happens here
) else (
  something to do if none of the other ifs are true
)</example>
This is a good candidate for using switch. The example below shows how this can be done:
<example>switch(v) do(
  case(0) do(
    something
  )
  case(1, 2) do(  # A case can contain multiple values...
    something else
  )
  case(3)
  case(4) do(  # ...or you can use multiple cases after another
    yet another thing
  )
  case(10) do()  #nothing happens here
  else(
    something to do if none of the cases happen
  )
)</example>
The <p>else</p> section is optional.
There are two different styles (syntaxes) in which switch can be written. The second style looks like this (completely equivalent to the above example):
<example>switch(v) do(
  case(0)    something
  case(1, 2) something else
  case(3)    
  case(4)    yet another thing
  case(10)   do() #nothing happens here
  case(else) something to do if none of the cases happen
)</example>
Besides readability, there is one other important difference between using switch and using a sequence of if's. The switch command only checks the value of the expression (v) once. The if/then/else method checks v repeatedly, so it could be slower, and could be susceptible to errors if you accidentally change the value of v somewhere in the middle.

		<description>
			Note that all of the wait commands wait for at least one tick,

			For example, "wait for textbox" waits for one tick even if there is no textbox.

			<warn>
				If a battle occurs, a menu is entered (unless it 'Allows Scripts') or
				another script is triggered, your script will be paused until the other
				thing finishes.
				While paused, any wait commands don't continue checking.
				For example, <ref>wait</ref> stops counting down, and

				Allows NPCs to walk through walls, including to leave the zone they are restricted to,

				Use <ref>resumenpcwalls</ref> to restore normal wall behavior.
				Use <ref>setnpcignoreswalls</ref>(who, true) instead to allow a single NPC to walk through walls.
				<note>
					If you use this command on a map with NPCs walking about normally
					you should use <ref>suspendnpcs</ref> first, otherwise NPCs will
					start walking into walls and get stuck there when you call
					<ref>resumenpcwalls</ref>!

					Usually it is better to use <ref>setnpcignoreswalls</ref>

				</note>
				<note>
					NPCs will still be unable to walk through each other, or to walk through
					the hero.

		<command id="walkhero">
			<canon>walk hero (who, direction, distance)</canon>
			<shortname>walk hero</shortname>
			<description>Makes the specified hero move in the specified direction for the specified number of tiles. The first argument tells who to move. Use <ref>me</ref> or numbers 0-3. The second argument is the direction. Use the constants: <ref>north</ref>, <ref>south</ref>, <ref>east</ref>, <ref>west</ref>, <ref>up</ref>, <ref>down</ref>, <ref>left</ref>, or <ref>right</ref>. The third argument is the number of tiles to move. If you leave out the third argument, the hero will move one tile. If you use a negative number for walk distance, the hero will walk backwards. Walk hero is usually used with the <ref>waitforhero</ref> command. You should normally use the <ref>suspendplayer</ref> command before moving heroes, and if you want to move heroes other than the leader, you should use the <ref>suspendcaterpillar</ref> command.</description>

If the destination cannot be reached at all, they will go to the closest reachable tile. The first argument <p>who</p> is the hero's rank in the caterpillar party, or <ref>me</ref> for the leader. When the caterpillar party is enabled, this command only works on the leader, and will do nothing for other heroes. Use <ref>suspendcaterpillar</ref> if you want to make the other heroes pathfind. Non-leader heroes do not treat NPCs as obstacles when they pathfind. The second argument is the destination <p>x</p> tile coordinate. The third argument is the destination <p>y</p> tile coordinate. The fourth argument <p>stuck ticks</p> is optional. If it is included, a hero who gets stuck along the way for more than the specified number of ticks will give up and stop pathfinding to the target. If <p>stop ticks</p> is omitted or zero, the hero will keep pathfinding even if it gets stuck, and will not stop until it reaches the destination, or is stopped with the <ref>cancelherowalk</ref> command.

The third argument <p>stop when reached</p> can be true if you want the chasing hero to stop after the first time it reaches the destination NPC. If ommitted or false, the hero will keep chasing even after it reaches a moving destination NPC. The fourth argument <p>stuck ticks</p> is optional. If it is included, a hero who gets stuck along the way for more than the specified number of ticks will give up and stop pathfinding to the target.

				<p>who</p> is a caterpillar slot; use <ref>me</ref> to refer to the leader.
				Normally only the speed of the leader matters,
				unless you use <ref>suspendcaterpillar</ref>,
				because the whole party moves at the leader's speed.
				<p>speed</p> defaults to 4.
				Tiles are 20 pixels in size, and speeds that do not divide evenly or nearly
				evenly into 20 will result in jerky movement.
				So only use speeds 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, or 20.
				<note>
					Changes to hero speed aren't saved in saved games!
				</note>
				<note>
					Hero speed is weird.
					It isn't actually a property of the hero, but of the caterpillar slot.
					So if you change the leader's speed and then a different hero is swapped
					into the leader position, the leader (and party) speed doesn't change.
					That's usually a good thing!
				</note>
				<danger>
					Don't set speed to zero while a hero is moving,
					it will cause the hero to stop mid-step and become misaligned with the grid
					and stuck.
					Wait for the hero to stop first or check with <ref>heroiswalking</ref>.

			<canon>use door (number, fade screen)</canon>
			<shortname>use door</shortname>
			<description>
				Instantly uses door <p>number</p>, just as if you had stepped into it.
				<p>fade screen</p> is an optional argument, defaulting to <tt>true</tt>.
				If true, the screen will fade out before using the door (even if it leads
				to the same map), and fade back in one tick later.
				Otherwise, there are no automatic screen fades.
				<note>
					An automatic <ref>wait</ref>(1) occurs immediately after this command.
				</note>
				<note>
					If you call <ref>fadescreenout</ref> immediately after <tt>use door</tt>,
					then the screen won't automatically fade back in afterwards.
					That's intentional, so that you can cancel the fade.
					(But you might have to do this in the map autorun script, if there is one,
					since it will suspend the script that called <tt>use door</tt>!)

			<description>
				(See <ref>npcref</ref> for an explanation of NPC references.)
				<lb/>
				Returns a reference to one of the NPCs on the map, or <tt>false</tt>/<tt>0</tt>
				if the NPC you asked for is not found on the map.
				<lb/>
				<p>ID</p> is the <ref>npcid</ref> of the NPC to look up.
				The ID is the same number that appears in CUSTOM when you are editing NPCs or placing NPCs on the map.
				(Unlike other NPC commands, this one does not accept an NPC reference in place of the NPC ID.)
				<lb/>
				<p>copy</p> is optional.
				It specifies which copy (instance) of the NPC you want, in case there are more than one on the map.
				If you don't specify it, you will just get a reference to the first copy.
				Copies are counted starting from zero.
				You can see the copy number of NPCs in the Map Editor, at the bottom of the NPC,
				and using the F6 NPC debugger, by hoving the mouse over an NPC.
				<lb/>
				<p>allow disabled?</p> is optional, and defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
				If <tt>true</tt>, when used on a copy of an NPC hidden due to tag conditions,
				<tt>NPC reference</tt> will return a reference instead of returning <tt>false</tt>.
				<lb/>
				<p>pool</p> is an optional <ref>npcpool</ref>.
				If you don't specify which pool, then the ID is assumed to refer to the local pool for the current map.
				See also the <ref>globalnpcreference</ref> command.
				<lb/>
				If you plan on using the same NPC reference many times in a script you can store it in a <ref>variable</ref>.

			<description>This command is for looping over all the npcs on the map, in the same way that <ref>firstchild</ref> and <ref>nextsibling</ref> can be used to iterate over all the children of a slice. When called with no argument or <tt>0</tt>, it returns an <ref>npcref</ref> to the first NPC on the map. When <p>npcref</p> is an NPC reference it returns a reference to the next NPC. It returns 0 when there are no more NPCs, and skips over NPCs that are disabled by a tag condition (including used one-time-use NPCs). It's safe to delete NPCs while you're iterating over them (unlike <ref>nextsibling</ref>!), but creating NPCs at the same time might result in them getting skipped.

			<canon>change NPC ID (reference, new ID, pool)</canon>
			<shortname>change NPC ID</shortname>
			<description>
				This command takes an <ref>npcref</ref> and lets you change the ID number
				of the NPC it points to, and change between local and global NPC pools.
				This means that the NPC will now use a different picture, palette,
				walking speed, text box, everything.
				This change is not permanent. It only lasts until the next time a map gets loaded.
				The <p>pool</p> argument is an optional <ref>npcpool</ref>.
				If you don't specify a pool, then the NPC ID will be assumed to be the same pool that the NPC was previously part of.
				<lb/>
				If <p>reference</p> is an NPC ID then this command acts on the first NPC instance
				of that ID/pool, and the pool is not changed.

			<canon>alter NPC (who, NPCstat, value, pool)</canon>
			<shortname>alter NPC</shortname>
			<description>
				Changes the stats of an NPC type.
				<tt>alter NPC</tt> can be used for many purposes.
				The following constants for this command are available:
				<lb/>
				<ul>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:picture,picture number)</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:palette,palette number)
						<lb/>
						Set the palette number to -1 to use the default palette.
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:move type,move type code)
						<lb/>
						Available move types:
						<ul>
							<li>NPCmovetype:standstill</li>
							<li>NPCmovetype:wander</li>
							<li>NPCmovetype:pace</li>
							<li>NPCmovetype:rightturns</li>

					</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:move speed,speed)</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:display text,text box number)</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:when activated,when activated code)
						<lb/>
						Available whenactivated codes:
						<ul>
							<li>NPCwhenactivated:changedirection</li>
							<li>NPCwhenactivated:faceplayer</li>
							<li>NPCwhenactivated:donotfaceplayer</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:give item,item number + 1)
						... Note that the item number is offset + 1. A zero means no item.
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:pushability,pushability code)
						<lb/>
						Available pushability codes:
						<ul>
							<li>NPCpush:off</li>
							<li>NPCpush:full</li>
							<li>NPCpush:horizontal</li>
							<li>NPCpush:vertical</li>
							<li>NPCpush:uponly</li>
							<li>NPCpush:rightonly</li>
							<li>NPCpush:downonly</li>
							<li>NPCpush:leftonly</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:activation,activation code)
						<lb/>
						Available activation codes:
						<ul>
							<li>NPCactivation:use</li>
							<li>NPCactivation:touch</li>
							<li>NPCactivation:stepon</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:onetime use flag,onetime flag ID)
						<lb/>
						The onetime flag (see <ref>checkonetime</ref>) is zero if the
						NPC is usable repeatedly.
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:tag1,tag ID)
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:tag2,tag ID)
						<lb/>
						These are two tag conditions which both have to be true for the NPC
						to appear. A tag ID of 0 means no check is done (the condition is true).
						A positive condition means that tag needs to be ON, a negative means
						that tag needs to be OFF.
						For example, tag1 = -4 and tag2 = 0 means the NPC appears only when
						tag 4 is OFF.
					</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:script,script ID)</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:script argument,number)</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:vehicle,vehicle ID+1)</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:default movement zone,zone ID)</li>
					<li>alter NPC (who,NPCstat:default avoidance zone,zone ID)</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:ignore passmap, true or false)
						<lb/>
						This is for the NPC editor setting, not the <ref>setnpcignoreswalls</ref> command.
					</li>
					<li>
						alter NPC (who,NPCstat:pathfinding rule,rule)
						<lb/>
						The <tt>rule</tt> (see the F1 help page for the NPC editor for more info) is one of:
						<ul>
							<li>pathfinding:default</li>
							<li>pathfinding:npcs obstruct</li>
							<li>pathfinding:npcs ignored</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Normally you would only give an NPC ID number to alter NPC,
				but if you want to use an <ref>npcref</ref> it will still work.
				Just remember that alter NPC changes every copy of the NPC on the map,
				not just the specific one you referenced.
				<lb/>
				The <p>pool</p> argument is an optional <ref>npcpool</ref>.
				It cannot be used if you are specifying the NPC by reference, since then that NPC reference's
				current npc pool will be used.
				<lb/>
				Changes to global npcs in <p>pool:global</p> will persist when you move to other maps,
				regardless of whether the map is set to remember NPC data.
				Those changes will be reset if you load a saved game or start a new game.
				<lb/>
				A good way to make use of <tt>alter NPC</tt> is to wrap it in your own script. For example:
				<example># Example alter NPC wrapper for changing NPC appearance
# Palette -1 means the default palette.
plotscript, change NPC, who, picture, palette = -1, begin
  alter NPC(who, NPCstat:picture, picture)
  alter NPC(who, NPCstat:palette, palette)
end</example>

				Resets the game and returns you to the title screen.
				This command is most useful for after-you-win-the-game type scripts,
				and for death-scripts that are triggered when you lose in battle.
				(The script calling <tt>game over</tt> ends immediately.)
				This command is similar to <ref>resetgame</ref>,
				the main difference being that if the title screen and load screen have both been disabled
				(the <tt>Skip title/load screen</tt> preference bitsets),
				<tt>game over</tt> will completely exit the game (either taking you back to the game select screen,
				or exiting to the operating system),
				while <ref>resetgame</ref> starts a new game.
				<note>
					The game will instantly transition to the title screen (or load menu, if the title is disabled)
					without a screen fade.
					So you probably want to call <ref>fadescreenout</ref> beforehand.
				</note>

					you can pass arguments to the newgame and loadgame scripts.

				Resets and starts a new game, skipping both title and load game screens.
				It can be necessary to use this instead of <ref>gameover</ref> so that the
				program will not exit if the title screen and load screen have both been disabled.
				It always resets the game back to the beginning and runs the new-game script.
				(The script calling <tt>reset game</tt> ends immediately.)
				You can pass any number of optional <p>args</p>, which become the arguments
				to the newgame script.
				For an example, see <ref>loadfromslot</ref>, which passes its arguments
				to the loadgame script in the same way.
				<danger>
					The default arguments of a newgame script (and all other triggered scripts)
					are currently ignored.
					If you don't pass enough <p>args</p>, then the remaining arguments default to zero.

				<note>

		<section title="Master Palette and Screen Fades">
		<description>
			Everything displayed on-screen uses colors from a 256-color master palette.
			Screen fading works by momentarily changing the colors in the palette,
			for example shifting them all to black.
			The screen fade commands are a very common source of confusion because they pause
			the engine during the fade, and don't redraw the screen at all.
			Instead, what is already on-screen (which was drawn in the <b>previous</b> game tick)
			is re-displayed with a new palette. So
			<example>fade screen out
show backdrop (1)
fade screen out</example>
			will <b>not</b> work as expected: the screen fades out, then it fades back in,
			then the backdrop appears instantly.
			You need to add a <ref>wait</ref><tt>(1)</tt> immediately after the <ref>showbackdrop</ref>
			so that the engine repaints the screen (still entirely black) with the backdrop
			before it fades the backdrop into view.
			<lb/>
			This works because there's both a 'visible' master palette and a 'loaded' one.
			<ref>fadescreenout</ref> smoothly changes the visible one to be all the same color
			but doesn't modified the loaded one.
			<ref>fadescreenin</ref> changes the visible one smoothly back to the loaded one.
			<ref>loadpalette</ref>, <ref>tweakpalette</ref>, <ref>writecolor</ref>, etc
			modify the loaded palette but not the visible one.
			You need to call either <ref>fadescreenin</ref> or <ref>updatepalette</ref>
			to copy the loaded palette to the visible one to make your changes visible.
			<ref>updatepalette</ref> instantly changes the visible palette to the loaded one.
			<lb/>
			For example, this means you can fade between two different master palettes like so:
			<example>load palette(2)
fade screen in</example>

			<description>Sets the 'intrinsic' amount of damage that a hero receives from attacks of a certain element, as a percentage of normal. (That is, the value entered in the 'Elemental Resistances' menu in Custom. Equipment elemental modifiers are added onto this value.) The argument <p>who</p> is the hero's position in the party, as returned by <ref>findhero</ref>. The argument <p>element</p> is a number from 0 to whatever the highest enabled element is. The argument <p>percent</p> is the percentage (written without a percent sign). For example -50 means the hero is healed by 50% of the attack damage instead of being hurt.<note>Unlike the elemental resist editors in Custom, you can't use fractions of a percent here.</note></description>

			<description>Uses an attack on a hero outside of battle as if you had used it from an item or cast it as a spell. In spite of the name, it works for both cure spells and damage spells.

			<note>If the attack results in all the heroes in the party being dead (outside of battles a hero isn't counted as dead if their maximum HP is zero or negative), a normal game over occurs: the game over script is run if there is one, otherwise the game ends.

			such for moving, running, jumping, or attacking repeatedly
			each time a cooldown expires (you'll need to script your own cooldown).
			For nearly everything else you will use <ref>keypress</ref>,

			such as when you script a menu
			(both activating menu items and moving the cursor - since the cursor moves in jumps rather than continually),
			or to use a special ability such throwing a ball.
			You should use <ref>keypress</ref> for key repeat for scripted menus.
			<note>
				You can NOT wait for the player to press a key by continually polling <ref>keyispressed</ref>, etc,
				in a <ref>while</ref> loop unless you stick a <ref>wait</ref> in your loop.

					It's not a good idea to rely on the key repeat rate for things that affect gameplay such as the rate at which you can shoot bullets!
					The repeat rate is once every 55 milliseconds (18 times a second), independent of the frames per second (fps) that
					the game is running at.
					Suppose you use key repeat to shoot bullets and your game runs at 36 fps,

					But if played on a really slow computer that only ran the game at 18 fps, a bullet will be fired every frame!

					(<tt>mouse button</tt> is fine for gameplay actions, like throwing projectiles.)
					<lb/>
					There are two reasons: firstly, that's how the mouse works in almost all software (try it!).
					Secondly, the engine itself uses 'mouse release' everywhere,
					so you may run into problems if you use <tt>mouse button</tt> for UI stuff.
					For example if you quit a custom menu on <tt>mouse button</tt> (ie the button is pushed down),
					but then the engine will do something like walk the hero to a tile when it sees the button goes back up,
					that'll cause an unwanted action.

	<section title="String Functions">
		<description>In HamsterSpeak, strings are special variables which hold pieces of text, and are referred to by their ID numbers. There are 100 string variables, with IDs 0 to 99. Strings variables can be displayed onscreen directly, or alternatively embedded in textboxes or displayed with text slices. For more information, see the <a href="rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Strings">wiki article on strings</a>.<lb/>
You can set the value of a string directly with <ref>__setstring__</ref> and append to an existing string with <ref>__appendstring__</ref>.
There is no limit on string length.<lb/>
<note>Unlike almost all other indices in the OHRRPGCE, when referring to a position in a string, <p>position</p> is a 1-based index into the string, not a 0-based index. For example, given a string "ABCDEFG", position=3 is "C", not "D". This means that position 0 is invalid. Beware!</note>
<note>Strings are not saved in saved games by default, but this can be enabled in the Saved Game Settings menu.</note></description>

			<description>
				Expands "embed" codes in string <p>ID</p> such as ${H1}, modifying the string.
				(See the textbox editor for the list of all available embed codes.)
				This does the same thing that textboxes do automatically.
				The <p>saveslot</p> argument is optional.
				If you leave it out, the string's codes will be expanded based on the currently running game state.
				If you specify a save slot number (from 1-1000) then the string will be expanded based on data
				(hero names, variables, strings, etc.) from that saved game.

			<description>Sets the contents of a string variable given by <p>id</p>, which can be a constant like 0 or 1, a variable, or even an expression like a call to a script, to a piece of text. The previous contents are erased. The whole statement must be on a single line; you can't split the text onto multiple lines (use multiple <ref>__appendstring__</ref> statements instead). The value of the whole statement is equal to <p>id</p> for convenience (see the example). The text (which is called a string literal) can contain certain escape codes (see examples below):<lb/>
\\ turns into a single \<lb/>
\" turns into a single " without signalling the end of the literal<lb/>
\n is a new line character, which can be used in text slices, <ref>showstring</ref>, <ref>showstringat</ref> and <ref>trace</ref>.<lb/>
\t is a tab character (which isn't useful at all as it doesn't actually cause a tab except when printing to a file with <ref>trace</ref>).<lb/>
\x## where ## is a two digit hexidecimal number adds an ASCII character to the string. For example \x4b is the letter K.</description>

			<description>
				Appends the decimal representation of <p>number</p> to the string with ID #<p>ID</p>.
				The optional <p>min length</p> argument can be used to add padding to the left or right.
				It's the minimum length of the string to append - if the number of digits
				(including the leading negative sign, if any)
				is less than this, then spaces or zeroes are added as padding:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the optional argument <p>pad with zeros</p> (which defaults to false)
						is false, then spaces are added to the left (left of the negative
						sign, if any)
					</li>
					<li>
						If <p>pad with zeros</p> is true, then zeroes are added to the left
						(to the right of the negative sign, if any)
					</li>
					<li>
						If <p>min length</p> is negative, then the padding is added to the
						right instead.
						E.g. -4 means a minimum length of 4, padded to the right.
						<p>pad with zeros</p> is ignored.

			<shortname>string sprintf</shortname>
			<description>Builds a string from a template (given by <p>format string ID</p>) and zero or more additional arguments, and puts the result in the string <p>dest string ID</p>. This is a restricted version of the sprintf function in other programming languages. This function takes at least 2 arguments. The format string is a mix of regular text and codes like %d. For each code, one argument is read and used to substitute for the code. The codes are:<lb/>
<p>%d</p>: substituted with a number, printed as a decimal.<lb/>
<p>%x</p>: substituted with a number, printed as a unsigned 32 bit hexidecimal, in lower case and without a leading 0x.<lb/>
<p>%o</p>: substituted with a number, printed as a unsigned 32 bit octal number, without a leading 0o.<lb/>
<p>%b</p>: substituted with a number, printed as a unsigned 32 bit binary number, with a space between every 8 bits, without a leading 0b.<lb/>
<p>%s</p>: substituted with a string. The argument should be a valid string ID.<lb/>
<p>%c</p>: substituted with a single character. The argument should be an ASCII code (that is, a number between 0 and 255).<lb/>
<p>%%</p>: substituted with a single %. In this case an argument is NOT used up.<lb/>
More sophisticated formatting codes like %-04d that are possible in other programming languages are not supported yet.

					Just because a slice handle is valid doesn't mean it points to the slice that you expected.
					After a slice is deleted, its handle can be reused for new slices!
					If you delete a slice but still have a slice handle to it stored in a variable,
					you must never access that handle again, because it will either be invalid,
					causing an error when you use it, or even worse, it will point to some
					random slice, which is a bug in your script!
					For alternatives to sliceisvalid, please see the examples.
				</danger>
				When you want to check whether the result of a slice command is a valid slice,
				you can just test whether the handle is <p>false</p>, as this example shows:
				<example>
variable(sl)
# Let's find a slice.
sl := lookup code(sl:textbox portrait box)
# Does this special slice exist?
# You could write if(slice is valid(sl)) then (....),
# and it would be correct to do so, but it's pointless.
# You should just write this instead:
if (sl) then (....)
# All commands that normally return a slice handle and might fail will return 'false',
# so there is never a need to use sliceisvalid in that situation.
				</example>
				The following example shows how to be safe when deleting a slice:
				<example>
global variable (1, bullet slice)

###### Suppose we have one script that creates a temporary slice:

plotscript, fire bullet, begin
	bullet slice := create rect (3, 3)
	...
end

###### And somewhere else (say, inside our main loop) we want to use it:

	# Test for collision with the player
	if (slice collide (bullet slice, get hero slice(me))) then (
		...

		###### Also, the temp slice can be deleted:
		# Bullet is destroyed
		free slice (bullet slice)
	)

###### Wait! First we need to test if there is a bullet slice at all, or we have an error.
###### You might be tempted to use sliceisvalid:

	if (slice is valid (bullet slice)) then (     # &lt;--- Sometimes returns WRONG result!
		# Test for collision with the player
		if (slice collide (bullet slice, get hero slice(me))) then (
			...
		)
	)

###### That's a mistake. Instead, you should make sure to set the variable
###### bulletslice to 0 in every single place you delete it.
###### Some of other places aren't obvious! They include leaving the map, or loading a saved game!

	if (bullet slice) then (     # &lt;--- Since we do the needed bookkeeping, this is correct
		# Test for collision with the player
		if (slice collide (bullet slice, get hero slice(me))) then (
			...
			# Bullet is destroyed
			free slice (bullet slice)
			bullet slice := 0     # &lt;--- Very important!
		)
	)

			<description>
				Deletes a slice and any child slices.
				This works on any type of slice.
				This removes the slice from the screen and removes it from memory.
				You should free your slices after you are completely done with them.
				<lb/>
				Freeing the same slice handle twice shows a warning
				(if slice error reporting is enabled, e.g. while testing your game).
				However, <tt>free slice (0)</tt> is fine.
				It's good practice to set a variable containing a slice handle to 0
				after you free it, so that the script can test whether the slice
				exists or not. (<ref>sliceisvalid</ref> is not reliable.)

				Search for an important slice using a <ref>lookupcode</ref>, and return a handle to it, or 0 if it is not found.
				You can optionally specify a slice for the <p>lookup slice</p> command to start searching from,
				but if you do not, the whole slice tree will be searched.
				<note>
					You can use a number as a lookup code, but usually you use a builtin code constant, starting with <tt>sl:</tt>

					Don't mix them up!
				</note>
				<note>Although the user-defined slice lookup codes are always safe to use for any purpose, there is a lot of potential mischief that you can do with a handle to a special slice. If you do anything dubious, like reordering, reparenting, or god forbid freeing the special slice, don't expect your scripts to work in later versions of the engine, which are likely to impose stricter restrictions! Deleting or reparenting special slices generally won't work. You may parent your own slices to these special slices, though.</note>
				<note>Be aware that when there is more than one slice with the same lookup code, the <p>lookup slice</p> command will only return the first one it finds in a depth-first search. If you need to find multiple slices with the same lookup code, you must search manually using <ref>getslicelookup</ref>.</note>
			You may <ref>setparent</ref> a slice to a map layer to make it move with the camera just like heroes and NPCs do.

			<shortname>fill parent</shortname>
			<description>Make a slice <p>handle</p> automatically fill its parent. This will change the position and size of the slice so that it completely fills the parent (minus the parent's padding). You can also disable filling with this command by passing <p>false</p> as the second argument, such as <p>fill parent(handle, false)</p>. If a slice is filling its parent, then any commands which modify the width or height of the slice will fail. You should resize the parent instead. This command only works on rects and containers. It will not work on sprites because they cannot change size.</description>

				Cause slice <p>handle</p> to start moving horizontally.

				The <p>ticks</p> argument is optional.
				If you do not specify the number of ticks, the slice will keep moving indefinitely.

					Movement in horizontal and vertical directions is independent,

If you use this command inside a loop that iterates through slices using <ref>nextsibling</ref> be careful not to accidentally create an endless loop.</description>
			<example>

  # then "slice to front" is safe and easy to use.
  variable(sl)
  sl := first child(sprite layer)
  slice to front(sl)
end

script, dangerous sorting, begin
  # this is an example of the WRONG way to move all rect slices to the
  # front in a loop. Because moving a slice to the front adds it to the
  # end of the list, the loop will go on forever.
  variable(sl)

  end
end

script, safe sorting, begin
  # This is an example of the right way to move all rect slices to the
  # front in a loop. By remembering which slice was last before the
  # loop starts (or by using "previous sibling") it is safe to move slices
  # to the end of the sibling list.
  # We also ensure the rects stay in the same relative order by writing
  # the loop so that we move the last slice to front if it is a rect.
  variable(sl, last, prev)
  last := last child(sprite layer)
  sl := first child(sprite layer)

				This is useful for emulating 3D (or "2.5D") environments, causing slices for objects that are closer to the "view"
				(the bottom of the screen) to be drawn on top of ones further away.

			<description>
				For a description of the different slice types, see the <a href="http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Slices#Slice_types">Slices</a> article on the wiki.
				<note>
					There are two types of slice used by the engine for which there are no commands:
					'special' slices (such as <ref>spritelayer</ref>),
					and 'map' slices (which are map layers).
					However you can use <ref>lookupslice</ref> to find each instance of these.
					Special slices are nothing but container slices with special purposes (but not special behaviour).
					None of these kinds of slices can be created or manipulated in the slice collection editor either.

				<lb/>
				The third argument is the total number of ticks that the animation should run.
				You can use <tt>dissolvetime:default</tt> or <tt>-1</tt> for the default number of ticks,
				which is equal to the sprites <tt>(width + height) / 10</tt>
				(this is not the same as the default length for enemy dissolves!)
				The fourth argument is the tick to start on, or 0 to start from the beginning.
				The fifth argument is false for a normal dissolve, or true for a backwards dissolve.
				The sixth argument is true for an automatic dissolve (the default),
				or false to prevent the dissolve animation from proceeding automatically, in case you want to manually control it.

			<shortname>set rect trans</shortname>
			<description>
				Given a rect slice <p>handle</p>, change how its background
				(the part that's not the border) is drawn.
				For <p>transparency setting</p>, pass in one of the constants:
				<ul>
					<li><tt>trans:fuzzy</tt> for checkered semi-transparency,</li>
					<li><tt>trans:blend</tt> for true transparency,</li>
					<li><tt>trans:hollow</tt> to not draw the background at all (only the border is drawn),</li>
					<li><tt>trans:solid</tt> (equal to <ref>false</ref>) for solid with no transparency.</li>
				</ul>
				When changing to <tt>trans:fuzzy</tt> and <tt>trans:blend</tt> the
				fuzziness/opacity defaults to 50% if it hasn't been previously set.
				Otherwise the previous value is restored:
				<example>set rect opacity(rect, 70)   # Becomes 70% opaque
set rect trans(rect, trans:solid)  # Becomes opaque
set rect trans(rect, trans:fuzzy)  # Becomes fuzzy with 70% fuzziness</example>
				<note>
					This command is less powerful than <ref>setrectfuzziness</ref>
					and <ref>setrectopacity</ref>,
					which together can change to any of the four <tt>trans:</tt> types,
					and also control the amount of transparency.

			Line slices are slighty different; their size doesn't exactly define the size of the rectangular part of the
			screen which they stretch across,
			but is instead used as the offset between their ends.
			Both ends are drawn inclusively.
			For example a width 10 height 0 Line slice positioned at x=50,y=20 will draw a line from 50,20 to 60,20,
			as a rectangle that's actually 11 pixels long and 1 pixel high.
			The line thickness is always 1 pixel.
			A width=0 height=0 line slice is a single pixel.
			<lb/>
			So you can give line slices a negative width or height too, to draw a line at any angle.
			The "top-left" alignment point of a line slice is its start point, and the "bottom-right" is its end point.

			Map Layer slices (also called Map slices) are special slices which display one of the
			tilemap layers of the current map.
			You can't create them; they always exist. Use <ref>lookupslice</ref> to get a handle
			for one of the map layer slices.
			They don't have any special attributes that you can access
			(use the <a href="#Tweaking Maps">map script commands</a> to modify the map instead),
			and you can't resize them or change their parent, but you can do anything else,
			such as move them about to create parallax effects,
			make them invisible, reorder them, change their autosort mode, and so forth.

					A point on the left or top edge of a slice counts as inside the slice,

			<shortname>check wall collision x/y</shortname>
			<description>
				Check how far an object (with a rectangular "hitbox") could move in a straight line on the map
				before hitting a wall (and possibly sliding along that wall).
				Provide the starting <p>x</p> and <p>y</p> map position in pixels of the top left
				corner of the hitbox (relative to the top-left of the map),
				its <p>width</p> and <p>height</p> in pixels,
				and the <p>relative x/y</p> offset of the target position of the object
				(for example <tt>relative x</tt> is 20 for one tile to the right).
				See <ref>moveslicewithwallchecking</ref> for information about what the optional <p>friction%</p>
				argument (which defaults to 100) does.
				<lb/>
				The return value is the maximum x or y offset
				(for <tt>check wall collision x</tt> or <tt>y</tt> respectively) that the object could move
				in a straight line towards the target before hitting a wall.
				If there are no walls in the way, then the return value is <p>relative x</p> or <p>relative y</p>.
				<lb/>
				For example, to check whether the hero can walk a full tile north (-20 pixels in the 'y' direction), you could write
				<example>if (check wall collision y(hero pixel x(me), hero pixel y(me), 20, 20, 0, -20) == -20) then (...)</example>
				(The <ref>checkherowall</ref> command is a much easier way to check the same thing,
				but only works if the hero is tile-aligned.)
				<lb/>
				These commands work on hitboxes of any size (as long as the size isn't negative),
				even several tiles wide.
				Even a one-pixel-wide overlap with the end of a wall counts as a collision,
				and edge-on walls count as obstructions too, as do tiles past the edge of the map
				(unless the map wraps around).
				However, if the hitbox starting position already overlaps any walls they will be ignored.
				<note>
					<ref>moveslicewithwallchecking</ref> is a more convenient way to check walls
					if you want to move a slice, e.g. when scripting a platformer.
				</note>
				<note>
					If you're moving diagonally, you'll need to call both
					<tt>check wall collision x</tt> and <tt>check wall collision y</tt> with identical
					arguments to find the x,y position of the collision point.
				</note>

			<canon>move slice with wallchecking (sl, relative x, relative y, friction%)</canon>
			<shortname>move slice with wallchecking</shortname>
			<description>
				Instantly moves a slice <p>sl</p> as far as possible in a straight line towards a point until
				it hits a wall in the map's wallmap (and possibly slides along that wall).
				<p>relative x/y</p> provide the point to move to, relative to the slice's current position.
				This command can be used on any slice, regardless of whether it is parented to a map layer.
				Its position on the map is calculated based on its on-screen position (<ref>slicescreenx</ref>, etc).
				The slice's "colliding box" (or "hitbox") is, as you expect, the same as its size.
				<lb/>
				It works on slices of any size (as long as the size isn't negative),
				even several tiles wide.
				Even a one-pixel-wide collision with the end of a wall will stop the slice,
				and edge-on walls count as obstructions too, as do tiles past the edge of the map
				(unless the map wraps around).
				However, if the slice already overlaps any walls they will be ignored.
				<lb/>
				<p>friction%</p> is an optional percentage value from 0 to 100 which defaults to 100.
				When it's 100, movement stops as soon as a wall is hit.
				If it's less than 100 then the slice slides down the wall with part of its remaining
				movement (<p>relative x/y</p>), reduced by <p>friction%</p> percent.
				For example if <tt>relative x == 15, relative y == 3, friction% == 30</tt> and
				the slice travelled right 5 pixels before hitting a wall to the north
				(x = 10, y = 2 movement remaining to go), then y movement gets set to 0 (because
				we hit a wall to the north) and x movement gets reduced by 30% to 7, and the slice
				slides up to another 7 pixels to the right (unless it hits another wall).
				<lb/>
				If you're creating a platformer or zelda-like, you probably want friction to be 0% or a low value.
				<lb/>
				The return value is a bitmask giving the directions in which the slice was
				blocked by a wall.
				The value is 0 if there was no collision.
				You can use the constants <ref>northwall</ref>, <ref>southwall</ref>, <ref>eastwall</ref>, <ref>westwall</ref>
				and the bitwise-<ref>and</ref> operator to 'test' the bitmask.
				For example <tt>bitmask, and, southwall</tt> 'tests' whether <p>sl</p>
				hit and is now resting against a wall on its south side (useful for a platformer).
				<lb/>
				Diagonally hitting the corner or end  of a wall exactly (including thin wall segments) is a special case.
				In that case the slice stops at the corner/end of the wall but is only touching it diagonally,
				and the return value is equal to one of
				the special constants <p>northeast corner</p>, <p>northwest corner</p>,
				<p>southeast corner</p>, <p>southwest corner</p>,
				all of which 'test' false when checked with
				<ref>northwall</ref>, <ref>southwall</ref>, <ref>eastwall</ref>, <ref>westwall</ref>.
				That's because the slice isn't actually resting against any walls, although it stopped!
				Use <ref>equal</ref>, not <ref>and</ref>, to check for these values.
				<lb/>
				You can check for walls without needing a slice using the alternative <ref>checkwallcollisionxy</ref> commands.
				<danger>
					This command hasn't been updated to support one-way walls yet.
					Running into a one-way wall edge-on will give strange results.

			<description>
				Changes the settings for a given timer, and starts it.
				<p>id</p> is the number of a timer -- by default, there are 16 timers, numbered 0 to 15
				but you can change the number of available timers with <ref>allocatetimers</ref>.
				All other parameters are optional, or you can pass <ref>timer:default</ref> as any of them.
				This will leave the parameter unchanged (from the last time you set it or from the default initial value),
				it will NOT cause that timer setting to be reset to the default initial value.
				<p>Count</p> is the length of the timer.
				While it's running, the count will go down by one every <p>speed</p> game ticks (frames).
				I.e., if you set speed to 18, it will count down once every 18 ticks, close to one second
				if using the default framerate of 18.3fps.
				Use a speed of 1 to count down in ticks.
				Changing the timer's <p>count</p> (as opposed to passing <p>timer:default</p> as the second argument)
				will cause the timer to restart from the new value.
				<lb/>
				<p>trigger</p> is what happens when the timer runs out.
				You can use the constant <ref>timer:gameover</ref> to indicate that the game should end (the gameover script is not called),
				or specify a plotscript (in the form <tt>@my script</tt>) to have that run.
				A plotscript will get passed the id of the timer that triggered it as its first argument, if it has one,
				unless you specify the arguments using <ref>settimerargs</ref>.
				If the timer runs out during a battle then the effect happens after the battle ends.
				<lb/>
				You can bind a timer to a string using the <p>string</p> parameter to create a countdown that shows up on screen.
				Pass it the id of a string, and that string will be updated every time the timer counts down.
				You are responsible for displaying and positioning the string.
				<lb/>
				A timer also has a few other options in the form of <p>flags</p>.
				You can pass any combination of these flags (by <ref>or</ref>ing them together; see the example):
				<ul>
					<li>
						<ref>timerflag:battle</ref> to have it count down during battles (including in menus which
						pause the battle, except the Pause screen itself).
						You can turn on the "Never show script timers during battles" Peference Bitset to
						cause battle-timers to count down but not display.
						Note: Only the first battle-timer will show in battle! You can't show more than one.
					</li>
					<li><ref>timerflag:menu</ref> to have it count down even while the player is in a menu which pauses the game (e.g. the status menu)</li>
					<li><ref>timerflag:critical</ref> to have the timer end a battle or exit a menu if it runs out during it</li>
				</ul>
				<lb/>
				<note>
					Timers start counting down not from the current game 'tick', but from next one.
					So if you want to trigger something next tick (eg. run a script every frame)
					you need to pass <p>count</p> as 0 and <p>speed</p> as 1.
					A timer count set to 1 would counter-intuitively trigger in 2 ticks time.
				</note>
				<note>
					Timer settings are not saved in saved games.
				</note>
			<example># This starts a 300 second (5 minute) timer that counts down once every 18 ticks (approximately one second).
# If it runs out during battle, the battle won't end but a game-over will happen afterwards.

				(If the timer isn't set to call a script this shows an error,
				so you have to call <ref>settimer</ref> before <tt>set timer args</tt>.)
				<lb/>
				This overrides the default first argument to the script, which is the timer ID.
				So if you want the timer ID to be first argument you have to write something like
				<lb/>
				<tt>set timer args(id, id, 20)  # Script gets args 'id, 20'</tt>
				<lb/>
				If you call this with no arguments (<tt>set timer args(id)</tt>)
				then all the script's arguments default to 0.
				If the script doesn't take as many args as you pass it the extra
				ones will be ignored without error.
				<warn>
					After the script runs the arguments will still be remembered for next time
					the timer is run (you can re-start a timer by calling <tt>set timer(id, count)</tt>),
					unless the script ID is changed (or set to 0).
				</warn>
				<danger>
					Due to a bug, the script's default arguments will be ignored,
					and missing arguments are instead set to 0.
					This happens whether you use <tt>set timer args</tt> or not, and affects
					all triggered scripts.
					This will be fixed in some future version.
				</danger>
				<example># This script changes the tile at x,y on tilemap 'layer' between tile IDs 'tile'
# and 'othertile' in the tileset every 5 ticks, repeating until the map changes.
script, blink tile, x, y, layer, tile, othertile, timerid, whichmap = -1, begin

  # Remember which map we started running on, and stop if the map changes
  if (whichmap == -1) then (
    whichmap := current map
  ) else (
    if (whichmap &lt;&gt; current map) then (exit script)
  )

  write map block (x, y, tile, layer)

  # Cause this script to run again in 10 ticks, but this time
  # swap 'tile' and 'othertile'
  set timer (timerid, 0, 10, @blink tile)
  set timer args (timerid, x, y, layer, othertile, tile, timerid, whichmap)
end

# Some timer IDs
define constant (10, timer:blink1)
define constant (11, timer:blink2)

# This is an auto-run script for a map
plotscript, blinky map, begin
  blink tile (4, 5, 0, 0, 1, timer:blink1)   # Blink x=4,y=5,layer=0 between tiles 0 &amp; 1
  blink tile (11, 10, 1, 5, 10, timer:blink2) # Blink x=11,y=10,layer=1 between tiles 5 &amp; 10

			<description>
				Returns the "count" of a given timer.
				A timer's count is at first equal to the <p>count</p> argument to <ref>settimer</ref>
				(or zero, if the timer hasn't been used).
				After <p>speed</p> ticks since <ref>settimer</ref> was called,
				the count is reduced by one.
				<lb/>
				The timer is triggered when the count becomes negative.
				Normally a timer that has finished has a count of -1,
				unless it had a negative count to begin with, most likely to happen
				if you restart a timer by passing <tt>timer:default</tt> as the <p>count</p> argument
				to <ref>settimer</ref>.
				(So if you keep repeating it that way, each time its count will reduce further: -1, -2, -3, ...)

			<description>
				Loads a range of globals from a saved game, overwriting the current globals in that range.
				<p>slot</p> is the save slot number, from 1 to 1000.
				Note that only slots 1-4 appear by default on the save/load menus.

				If you leave out both of <p>first</p> and <p>last</p> all global variables will be imported.
				<lb/>
				To read a single global from a save slot without modifying any of your globals,
				use the form <tt>var := import globals (slot, id)</tt>.
				This is NOT the same thing as <tt>import globals (slot, id, id)</tt>,
				which does modify the global variable.
				<lb/>
				<tt>import globals</tt> and <ref>exportglobals</ref> can be used to save and
				retrieve info about a saved game without loading it,
				and also to store variables that any game the player starts can use,
				such as high scores and other "global" data, like in the following example:
				<example>global variable (100, game completed)
global variable (101, hours to complete)
global variable (102, minutes to complete)

plotscript, game finished, begin
  game complete := true
  hours to complete := hours of play
  minutes to complete := minutes of play
  export globals (5, 100, 102) #special slot that the player can not load, which we can use for anything
end

plotscript, check game finished, begin
  import globals (5, 100, 102) #copy saved values into globals 100, 101, 102
  if (game completed) then (
    show textbox (105) #"you have previously finished this game in ${V101} hours and ${V102} minutes"
  ) else (

end</example>
				<note>
					You can import globals from an empty save slot; it's not an error to do so.

				The <p>run script by id</p> command allows you to run a script using its <ref>scriptid</ref>.
				You can get the ID of a script by writing <p>@</p> (the 'reference' operator)
				in front of its name, see the example.
				You can not run a built-in command like <ref>wait</ref>; they aren't scripts.
				Arguments after the ID will be passed to the script.
				The return value of this command is whatever value the script returns.
				A run-time error is displayed and -1 is returned if the script does not exist.
				You can pass up to 31 arguments to the script.
				<lb/>
				The advantage of this command as opposed to just calling the script
				directly is that the ID may be stored in a variable,
				or it could be the function return value of another script.
				For example, using <ref>setsliceextra</ref> you might want to store the ID
				of a script that should be run when the player clicks on a slice.

					If you pass too few arguments, the unspecified ones will have value zero
					<b>regardless</b> of any default values given in the script declaration.
					This bug will be fixed in some future version.

				<warn>
					This command is only implemented on Android!

				This asks the player if they want to send an email to you, optionally
				with a save file attached.
				The purpose is to make it easy for players to send bug reports or feedback,
				especially on Android, where it might otherwise be a nuisance to send saved games.

				When called on Android, a standard system menu is brought up asking the player which
				email client they want to use.
				If they don't cancel, that client is opened with an email already filled out,
				which they can edit as usual:
				<lb/>
				The email is sent to the address set in the Distribute Game->Distribution Info menu.
				<lb/>
				<p>subject string id</p> is optional; it is the id of a string containing the email
				subject line.
				If you leave it out or set it to -1 then the default subject line is "[Name of the game] feedback".
				<lb/>
				<p>message string id</p> is optional; it is the id of a string containing the email body text.
				If you leave it out or set it to -1 then it defaults to "(Please include a helpful description of the problem here)".
				<lb/>
				The <p>save slot</p> argument is optional, and is either an existing save slot number,
				or <p>false</p> (the default) to not attach a save.
				You can use <ref>saveinslot</ref> with a large slot number to create a temporary save of the current game.
				If you attach an save file two other files are also attached: g_debug.txt and g_debug_archive.txt.
				g_debug.txt is useful for tracking down OHRRPGCE engine bugs,
				but you can also write to it using <ref>trace</ref> and <ref>tracevalue</ref>.
				You can also check it for error messages, such as script errors (errors will start with
				a <p>!</p> at the beginning of the line).
				g_debug_archive.txt contains backups of g_debug.txt from previous times the game was played.
				<lb/>
				To load the .rsav file, rename it if necessary (e.g. 0.rsav for the first save slot),
				and put it in the 'gamename.saves' folder.

	<section title="Types and Handles" topics="yes">
		<description>
			This section documents many of the different types of values that are used by various script
			commands, such as NPC references.
			Note that in HamsterSpeak everything is a number, so there are no types
			as in other programming languages; instead identifiers are used for everything.
			Values of different ID numbers and handles overlap: there's no way to tell if
			a number refers to an NPC or a slice or a map.
			<ul>
				<li>
					An <p>ID number</p> normally refers to something which is defined
					in an editor, such as an NPC definition or map ID number,
					or something which is fixed supply, like global and string ID numbers.
					ID numbers always count upwards from 0 or sometimes 1.
					Many IDs have constants automatically defined, for example if there's
					a map named Overworld, there's a constant named <p>map:Overworld</p> with its ID number.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <p>handle</p> or a <p>reference</p> is an identifier for something that can
					be created during play, like slice handles, menu handles and NPC references.
					It can change from game to game, and it becomes invalid if the thing
					it refers to is deleted.
					After becoming invalid, the value can generally even be reassigned to a new thing of that type,
					so be careful about handles you've stored in variables when deleting things!
				</li>
				<li>
					A <p>constant</p> (or "enum") is a fixed value, used for things that
					don't change, like different available NPC movement types, or map numbers.
					Many constants in HamsterSpeak start with a prefix like <p>key:</p>.
					There's nothing special about these prefixes or names, and <p>:</p> is treated
					like any letter which you can use freely.

				These always default to the local pool, and you need to first use
				<ref>npcreference</ref> or <ref>globalnpcreference</ref>
				if you want to refer to a global NPC by ID.

			<shortname>NPC reference</shortname>
			<description>
				What is an NPC reference?
				A reference is a number that uniquely identifies an NPC instance on the map.
				You can use an NPC reference to specify which NPC you are controlling in most NPC-related commands.
				<lb/>
				NPC references are handles for NPC instances on the map,
				that is, a copy of an NPC definition.
				NPC references are always negative values, while NPC IDs count from 0 up.
				An <ref>npcid</ref> can always be used with any command that expects
				an NPC reference, in which case it refers to the first
				instance/copy of that NPC ID from the local <ref>npcpool</ref>, not to the NPC definition itself.
				(If you want to refer to a global NPC, you need to first use <ref>globalnpcreference</ref>.)
				So <tt>wait for NPC(5)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>wait for NPC(<ref>npcreference</ref>(5, 0))</tt>.
				<note>
					If you want to loop over all NPC instances (that is, over all NPC references), use
					<ref>nextnpcreference</ref>.
					An NPC reference historically was (and still is for now) a number between -1 and -300,
					but that will change in an upcoming version.
					So it's strongly recommended that you don't loop over values -1 to -300.
				</note>
				<warn>
					If you move to a different map you mustn't use the old references on the new map.
					If you set the map to save NPC data when leaving, the previous references will be valid when you get back to it.
				</warn>

		<command id="slicehandle">
			<canon>Slice handles</canon>
			<shortname>slice handle</shortname>
			<description>
				Slices are referred to with <p>slice handles</p>. A slice handle is just a value that you can store in a <p>variable</p>,
				just like an <ref>npcref</ref> or a <ref>menuhandle</ref>.
				A handle is <p>valid</p> if it currently refers to an existing slice.
				<ref>false</ref> (zero) is never a valid slice handle, so slice commands return 0 to indicate "no slice found" or similar failures.
				<note>
					<ref>lookupcode</ref>s like "sl:map layer 0" or "sli:quit button" are NOT slice handles;
					they can only be used by the <ref>lookupslice</ref> command.
				</note>

		<command id="blendableslicehandle">
			<canon>Blendable slice handles</canon>

				A <ref>slicehandle</ref> for a slice type which has blending settings (opacity and blend mode),
				which currently are Sprite and Map (map layer) slices.
				More slice types will become blendable in future versions.
				<note>
					Rectangle slices aren't blendable, however the background of a
					rect <b>can</b> be made transparent using <ref>setrectopacity</ref>
					instead of <ref>setopacity</ref>.
					This doesn't make the box border transparent, and <ref>getopacity</ref>
					will still return 100.

			<canon>Slice lookup codes</canon>
			<shortname>slice lookup code</shortname>
			<description>
				Slice lookup codes are used to search for a particular slice using <ref>lookupslice</ref>.
				There are two types.
				User defined slice lookup codes are
				defined (named) in the slice collection editor.
				You will find them as constants in your .hsi file with sli: prefixes, and they count up from 1.
				You can also use any non-negative value, even if you haven't named it in the editor.
				There are also many special slice lookup codes with names that start with sl: prefixes.
				See <ref>lookupslice</ref> for the list. They are always negative.

		<command id="menuhandle">

			<description>
				A handle for a currently open menu, for example, the one returned by <ref>openmenu</ref> or
				<ref>createmenu</ref> or <ref>topmenu</ref>.
				Menu handle <p>0</p> (<p>false</p>) means none/invalid.

			<shortname>menu item handle</shortname>
			<description>
				A handle to one of the items in a currently open menu,
				for example, the one returned by <ref>selectedmenuitem</ref>.
				Menu items in different menus are always different, so it's possible to lookup
				which menu its in with <ref>parentmenu</ref>, and menu handles are never reused.

		<command id="scriptid">
			<canon>Script IDs</canon>
			<shortname>script ID</shortname>
			<description>
				Script IDs are used to refer to scripts, for example for <ref>setdeathscript</ref>.
				Get the ID of a script by writing <p>@name of the script</p>, which is a constant.
				You can call a script using its ID instead of the normal way with <ref>runscriptbyid</ref>.
				You used to have to manually assign IDs to scripts using <tt>define script</tt>,
				but that's now obsolete and IDs are automatically assigned.
				The ID number of a script will remain the same as long as it isn't renamed,
				so they're safe to store in saved games.
				The ID <p>0</p> means no script (e.g. no death script).

				A number indicating a color in the master palette.
				A value from 1-255 is specifies the master palette index directly.
				The meaning of 0 depends on the particular script command:
				it might mean either 'transparent' or 'the default color'
				or 'color 0 in the palette'.
				Negative values are <tt>ui:...</tt> constants, for colors defined in
				the User-Interface Colors editor.
				(You can get the master palette index for a <tt>ui:</tt> constant with <ref>getuicolor</ref>.)

				<note>
					Previously it was necessary to <tt>include, scancode.hsi</tt>
					to use the <tt>key:</tt> constants, but no longer.
				</note>
				<note>
					If the "Map joystick controls to keyboard keys for scripts" general preference
					bitset is ON (which it is by default), then checking the
					<tt>key:up</tt>, <tt>key:down</tt>, <tt>key:left</tt>, <tt>key:right</tt>,
					<tt>key:esc</tt>, <tt>key:enter</tt> keys will report <tt>true</tt>
					if the corresponding button on any joystick is pressed.
				</note>
				<note>
					Since Zenzizenzic, keyboard support has been improved: some keys (such as key:down and key:numpad 2)
					which were previously the same scancode are now distinct (read scancode.hsi for the complete list).
					However for backwards compatibility, the old behaviour is emulated
					(so you won't be able to tell the two keys apart even if recompile and use the new, distinct scancodes)
					unless you turn off &quot;Disable better scancodes for scripts&quot;
					in the Backwards-Compatibility settings menu (in the General Game Settings menu).

			<canon>Key Constants</canon>
			<shortname>Key Constants</shortname>
			<description>
				A constant specifying a keyboard key or joystick button by its builtin function.
				(Possibly includes mouse buttons too, if enabled in the Mouse Controls menu.)
				They can be passed to <ref>keyispressed</ref>, <ref>keyval</ref>, <ref>waitforkey</ref>,
				<ref>keypress</ref>, <ref>newkeypress</ref> and <ref>waitforscancode</ref>.
				<lb />
				Previously these could only be used with the <ref>waitforkey</ref> command, but that's changed!
				<lb />
				Possible values:
				<lb />
				<p>any key</p>, <p>up key</p>, <p>down key</p>, <p>left key</p>, <p>right key</p>,
				<p>use key</p>, <p>menu key</p>, <p>cancel key</p>, <p>flee key</p>, <p>run key</p>.
				<lb />
				(<p>flee key</p> and <p>run key</p> are different names for the same constant;
				<p>menu key</p> and <p>cancel key</p> used to be the same but are now different:
				the Start button on a gamepad is a menu key.)
				<note>
					All commands which accept a key constant can also accept a scancode (like <tt>key:enter</tt>) instead.
					See <ref>scancode</ref>.

<lb/>The current value of a stat is what is normally used.

<lb/>The maximum value of a stat is used for limiting it (such as for curing items) and for resetting it, such as on levelup or at an inn (if enabled by the game's general bitsets).
