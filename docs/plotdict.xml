DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS XML FILE:

This markup (hereby refered to as PDL (Plotscript Dictionary Language)) is
designed to reduce the time spent maintaining the Plotscripting Dictionary, and
to enable easier porting to other formats.

The root element is the <plotscript> element. It has a lastmodified attribute,
which is the text date that the file was last modified. Update this when you
make a change.

In <plotscript>, there is a series of <section> elements, each with a title
attribute. These are to group the plotscripting commands into logical groups,
such as <section title="Wait Commands"> or <section title="Math Operators">

The heart of the PDL are the <command> elements inside the <section>s. It has a
single attribute, id. This is essentially the whitespace stripped version of the
command (the "wait for text box" command would have an id of "waitfortextbox").
This is used to uniquely identify each command. It's used in many ways, from
crosslinking command entries to generating a file for HssEd to use.

Inside the <command> element are either two or four+ elements, in this order:
Case 1: Full command definition
  <canon> - This is the "canonical" form of the command: the fully spaced
  			 command with parameter prototypes. Example: move hero to x (who, x)
  <shortname> - This is the short version of the command, used for crosslinking,
  				indexes, etc. It is the <canon> element, minus the parameters.
  				Example: move hero to x
  <description> - This is a paragraph (or more) of text describing what the
  				  command does, and how to use it. Use <lb/> to put paragraphs
  				  in, and <p></p> when referring to a parameter (to avoid user
  				  confusion) No HTML is allowed (at this time) Example: Well, it
  				  would be pretty long...
  <example>* - Finally, most commands should have some sort of example on how to
  			   use the command. It will be displayed in a mono-space font, so
  			   it's easy to Plotscript. But, be sure to format it properly:
			   Example:
			   <example># first example line has no line-break
# the second (and more) lines should have no indentation
# and so forth</example>

Case 2: Alias command definition
  <alias> - If a command is an alias to another command (or is so closely
  			related that they're in the same entry, use the <alias> element. Put
  			the ID of the real command in here. Example: begin
  <shortname> - Aliases also need a short name, since they are technically
  				different from their alias. Example: end

Basically, you should be able to examine the entries that already exist. It's
fairly self evident what everything does.

These are cut-and-paste copies of <command> elements, so you don't have to type
everything out 10000000000 times. They are also indented properly for this file.

Which reminds me: Indentation. For each "level" you go down in the hierarchy,
you indent once. Many code specific editors will maintain this indentation level
for until you explicitly change it, so it isn't difficult. Notepad users will
have to do it manually, but you MUST do it. Remember: 1 indent = 1 tab.

			<description>The plotscript command contains a list of commands that can be triggered directly by an event in your game. Plotscript starts with the keyword plotscript, a comma, and then the name of the plotscript. If there are any arguments to the script, you list their names separated by commas after the name of the script with default values. Then comes the text of the script. It is enclosed in <ref>begin</ref> and <ref>end</ref> statements. Scripts that are defined as plotscripts can be called directly from events in your game, or by name within other scripts.</description>
			<example># example of a simple script
plotscript,my first script,begin
	# commands go here
end</example>
			<example># example of a script with arguments
plotscript,my fancy script,fe=0,fi=0,fo=0,begin
	# commands go here,
	# and they can use the aruments fe, fi, and fo
	# that where passed to the script
end</example>

		<command id="globalvariable">
			<canon>global variable (id,name)</canon>
			<shortname>global variable</shortname>
			<description>Creates a global variable that can be used in any script. The first argument to the global variable declaration is a unique ID number. The second argument is the name of the variable. The ID number for a global variable is a number from 0 to 16383. Each global variable must have a unique number, but this number will not conflict with the ID numbers you use for scripts. It is all right to have a script and a global variable with the same ID number. See also <ref>variable</ref></description>
			<example># any script can read and set the value of a global
global variable(1,mini game score)</example>

			<canon>variable (name)</canon>
			<shortname>variable</shortname>
			<description>Creates a local variable that can only be used inside the script where it was created. The value of this variable is lost when the script ends. If you need a variable who&apos;s value persists between calls to a script, or that is automatically saved when the player saves their game, you will need to use a <ref>globalvariable</ref> instead.</description>

			<description>Creates a global constant. The first argument is the number that the constant will represent, and the second argument is the name of the constant. Use constants to replace commonly used numbers with friendly names. The following are some general purpose constants have been declared for you in plotscr.hsd (there are hundreds more intended for specific commands):<lb /><ref>zero</ref> <ref>one</ref> <ref>two</ref> <ref>three</ref> <ref>four</ref> <ref>five</ref> <ref>six</ref> <ref>seven</ref> <ref>eight</ref> <ref>nine</ref> <ref>ten</ref> <ref>false</ref> <ref>true</ref> <ref>off</ref> <ref>on</ref> <ref>north</ref> <ref>east</ref> <ref>south</ref> <ref>west</ref> <ref>up</ref> <ref>down</ref> <ref>left</ref> <ref>right</ref> <ref>me</ref> <ref>none</ref></description>

		<command id="include">
			<canon>include, filename</canon>
			<shortname>include</shortname>
			<description>The include command inserts another text file into your script. It is followed by a single filename that tells what file will be included. Windows long filenames are not supported. Every plotscript file should start with include, plotscr.hsd The PLOTSCR.HSD file contains definitions and constants for most of the other plotscripting commands.</description>

		<command id="walkhero">
			<canon>walk hero (who, direction, distance)</canon>
			<shortname>walk hero</shortname>
			<description>Makes the specified hero move in the specified direction for the specified number of tiles. The first argument tells who to move. Use <ref>me</ref> or numbers 0-3.

The third argument is the number of tiles to move. If you leave out the third argument, the hero will move one tile. Walk hero is usually used with the <ref>waitforhero</ref> command. You should normally use the <ref>suspendplayer</ref> command before moving heroes, and if you want to move heroes other than the leader, you should use the <ref>suspendcaterpillar</ref> command.</description>

			<canon>NPC reference (ID, copy)</canon>
			<shortname>NPC reference</shortname>
			<description>What is an NPC reference? A reference is a number that uniquely identifies an NPC on a map. You can use an NPC reference to specify which NPC you are controlling in most NPC-related commands. The first argument to NPC reference is the ID number of the NPC you want to work with. The ID is the same number that appears in CUSTOM.EXE when you are editing NPCs or placing NPCs on the map. The second argument is optional. It specifies which copy of the NPC you want, in case there are more than one on the map. If you don't specify which copy you want, you will just get a reference to the first NPC on the map with the right ID. Copies are counted starting from zero. You can see the copy number of NPCs in the Map Editor if you placed them in Custom. If the NPC ID/copy which you asked for is not found on the map then NPC reference will return <ref>false</ref>.<lb/> If you plan on using the same NPC reference many times in a script you can store it in a <ref>variable</ref>.<note>NPCs hidden due to tag conditions are never returned by this command.</note></description>

You can optionally pass an argument of <ref>false</ref> to make the menu display without actually loading or quiting. If you do this, you'll need to interpret the return value to find out which option the player selected: positive values are save slot numbers, 0 means New Game and -1 is Quit.</description>

		<command id="teachspell">
			<canon>teach spell (hero,attack)</canon>
			<shortname>teach spell</shortname>
			<description>Tries to teach a hero a spell. This only works when the spell is set to "learned from item" in one of the hero's spell lists; it will not work for spells learned based on level. The first argument is the hero&apos;s position in the party (as returned by <ref>findhero</ref>). The second argument is the attack to learn. You can use the names defined in your .HSI file in the form atk:attackname. (You may also use the attack&apos;s ID number. This is the number you see in the attack editor + 1.) If the hero was taught the spell, teach spell will return <ref>true</ref>, or if the hero cannot learn the spell (perhaps because they already know it) it will return <ref>false</ref>. Use <ref>writespell</ref> to add a spell to a spell list without restriction.</description>

			<canon>read spell (hero,list,slot)</canon>
			<shortname>read spell</shortname>
			<description>Returns the ID number of a chosen spell slot, or 0 (<ref>false</ref>) if there is no spell in that slot. The first argument is the hero&apos;s position in the party (as returned by <ref>findhero</ref>). The second argument is the number of the spell list to check. This is a value from 0 to 3. The third argument is the slot to check. This is a number from 0 to 23. Spell slots are numbered in rows, so the first row is 0,1,2 the second row is 3,4,5, and so-on.</description>
		</command>
		<command id="writespell">
			<canon>write spell (hero,list,slot,attack)</canon>

The second argument is the spell list to put the spell in. This is a number from 0 to 3. The third argument is the slot to put the spell in. This is a number from 0 to 23. Spell slots are numbered in rows, so the first row is 0,1,2 the second row is 3,4,5, and so-on. The last argument is the attack to put in the spell list. You can use the names defined in your .HSI file in the form atk:attackname (You may also use the attack&apos;s ID number. This is the number you see in the attack editor + 1). You can also erase a spell by writing 0 or <ref>none</ref> as the attack ID. Note that this command will overwrite and replace any spell that is already in that slot.

			<canon>update level up learning(who, allowforget)</canon>
			<shortname>update level up learning</shortname>
			<description>Update a hero to make sure they know the spells they are supposed to have learned for their current level. The <p>who</p> is the hero's position in the battle party. You can optionally pass <ref>false</ref> as the <p>allowforget</p> argument if you want to make sure the hero will not forget any spells that they are not supposed to know yet. This command is most useful for situations where you are manipulating the hero's level, and for some reason do not want to use <ref>setherolevel</ref> which automatically handles spell learning. This command can also be handy when playtesting a game in progress, since it can be used to make sure that heroes loaded from a saved-game will learn spells that did not exist yet at the time when they got their last level-ups.</description>

			<canon>map cure (attack, target, attacker)</canon>
			<shortname>map cure</shortname>
			<description>Uses an attack on a hero outside of battle as if you had used it from an item or cast it as a spell. In spite of the name, it works for both cure spells and damage spells. The first argument, <p>attack</p> is name of the attack from your HSI file in the form atk:name. (You may also use the attack&apos;s ID number. This is the number you see in the attack editor + 1.) The second argument, <p>target</p> is the position in the party of the hero to cure (or harm). The third optional argument, <p>attacker</p> is the position in the party of the hero who is using the attack. If this argument is omitted or set to -1, then the average stats of the active party will be used, just like when the attack is used from an item. The return value is <ref>true</ref> if the cure/attack succeeded, and <ref>false</ref> if it did nothing.
			<note>The <p>map cure</p> command replaces the old command <p>outside battle cure</p> which had a bug which required you to use <p>atk:name -- 1</p></note>

		<command id="initmouse">
			<canon>init mouse</canon>
			<shortname>init mouse</shortname>
			<description>Informs the engine that you intend to use the mouse. This command should be run before any mouse functions are be used. It causes the normal mouse cursor to be hidden when over the game's window, and causes mouse clicks to trigger on-keypress scripts. Therefore, it is a good idea to place this command in the newgame and loadgame scripts if you are going to use the mouse.<lb/><note>Running this command does not draw a cursor onscreen - your script must do this itself by placing a slice or npc at the appropriate location.</note> Here is an example:</description>
			<example>include,plotscr.hsd

#Mouse cursor example

plotscript, display mouse, begin

  #start up the mouse
  init mouse

  #loop while the game is running
  while (true) do,begin

The only purpose of this command is additional error checking.</description>

		<command id="loadslicecollection">
			<canon>load slice collection (id)</canon>
			<shortname>load slice collection</shortname>
			<description>Loads a collection of slices that you have defined in the slice collection editor. The argument is the <p>id</p> number of the collection. The return value is a handle to the container that holds the loaded collection.</description>

		<command id="lookupslice">
			<canon>lookup slice (lookup code, start slice)</canon>
			<shortname>lookup slice</shortname>
			<description>Search for an important slice using a lookup code, and return a handle to it, or 0 if it is not found. User defined slice lookup codes are defined in the slice collection editor. You will find them as constants in your .hsi file with sli: prefixes. There are also some special slice lookup codes with names that start with sl: prefixes. You can optionally specify a slice for the <p>lookup slice</p> command to start searching from, but if you do not, the whole slice tree will be searched.
				<note>Although the user-defined slice lookup codes are always safe to use for any purpose, There is a lot of potential mischief that you can do with a handle to a special slice. If you do anything dubious, like reordering, reparenting, or god forbid freeing the special slice, don't expect your scripts to work in later versions of the engine, which are likely to impose stricter restrictions! You may parent your own slices to these special slices, but moving special slices around is definitely a bad idea.</note>
				<note>Be aware that when there is more than one slice with the same lookup code, the <p>lookup slice</p> command will only return the first one it finds in a depth-first search. If you need to find multiple slices with the same lookup code, you must search manually using <ref>getslicelookup</ref>.</note>
			You may <ref>setparent</ref> a slice to a map layer to make it move with the camera just like heroes and NPCs do.

			<description>Assign a sort order value to a slice <p>handle</p>.

Give a slice a low number to sort it to the back or a high number to sort it to the front. This means it functions like (or can be used as) a z-depth.

This zeroing out behaviour is intended to let you use temporary sort values to perform some sorting operation on sibling slices (see especially the examples to <ref>slicetofront</ref> and <ref>slicetoback</ref>).</description>

plotscript, reverse Y sort, begin

			<description>Make a slice <p>handle</p> automatically fill its parent. This will change the position and size of the slice so that it completely fills the parent (minus the parent's padding). You can also disable filling with this command by passing <p>false</p> as the second argument, such as <p>fill parent(handle, false)</p>. If a slice is filling its parent, then any commands which modify the width or height of the slice will fail. You should resize the parent instead. This command only works on rects and containers.

			<description>Returns <ref>true</ref> if the keyboard key with the specified scancode is being pressed (either held down or pressed since last tick), or <ref>false</ref> if it is not. The argument is a scancode, NOT the <ref>upkey</ref>, <ref>downkey</ref>, etc used with <ref>waitforkey</ref>. An extra include file, <p>scancode.hsi</p>, is provided which you should <ref>include</ref> in order to use the following scancode constants.<lb/>

<note>Since Zenzizenzic, keyboard support has been improved: some keys (such as key:down and key:numpad 2) which were previously the same scancode are now distinct (read scancode.hsi for the complete list). However for backwards compatibility, the old behaviour is emulated (so you won't be able to tell the two keys apart even if recompile and use the new, distinct scancodes) unless you turn on the &quot;Enable better scancodes for scripts&quot; Preference Bitset in the General Game Settings menu.</note>
<note>You can't rely on the behaviour of the caps-, scroll- and num-lock keys. They might report on/off state instead of pressed/not pressed, depending on the graphics backend, operating system, and engine version.</note>
<note>You can NOT wait for the player to press a key by continually polling <p>key is pressed</p> unless you stick a <ref>wait</ref> in your <ref>while</ref> loop. That's because <p>key is pressed</p> does not return real time data, but the state of the keyboard at the beginning of the current game tick.</note>

			<description>Returns a bitmask for the state of the specified key. The argument is a scancode, see <ref>keyispressed</ref>.

		<command id="settimer">
			<canon>set timer (id, count, speed, trigger, string, flags)</canon>
			<shortname>set timer</shortname>
			<description>Changes the settings for a given timer, and starts it. <p>id</p> is the number of a timer -- by default, there are 16 timers, numbered 0 to 15, but you can change the number of available timers with <ref>allocatetimers</ref>. All other parameters are optional, or you can pass <ref>timer:default</ref> as any of them. This will leave the parameter unchanged (from the last time you set it or from the default initial value), it will NOT cause that timer setting to be reset to the default initial value. <p>Count</p> is the length of the timer. While it's running, the count will go down by one every <p>speed</p> game ticks (frames). I.e., if you set speed to 18, it will count down once every 18 ticks, close to one second. Use a speed of 1 to count down in ticks. Changing the timer's <p>count</p> (as opposed to passing <p>timer:default</p> as the second argument) will cause the timer to restart from the new value.<lb/>
<p>trigger</p> is what happens when the timer runs out. You can use the constant <ref>timer:gameover</ref> to indicate that the game should end, or specify a plotscript (in the form "@my script") to have that run. A plotscript will get passed the id of the timer that triggered it as its first argument, if it has one. If the timer runs out during a battle then the effect happens after the battle ends.<lb/>
You can bind a timer to a string using the <p>string</p> parameter to create a countdown that shows up on screen. Pass it the id of a string, and that string will be updated every time the timer counts down. You are responsible for displaying and positioning the string.<lb/>
A timer also has a few other options in the form of <p>flags</p>. You can pass any combination of these flags (by <ref>or</ref>ing or <ref>add</ref>ing them together): <ul><li><ref>timerflag:battle</ref> to have it count down during battles (not including menus which pause the battle)</li><li><ref>timerflag:menu</ref> to have it count down even while the player is in a menu which pauses the game (e.g. the status menu), the in-battle pause button doesn't count</li><li><ref>timerflag:critical</ref> to have the timer end a battle or exit a menu if it runs out during it</li></ul><lb/><note>Timers start counting down not from the current game 'tick', but from next one. So if you want to trigger something next tick (eg. run a script every frame) you need to pass <p>count</p> as 0 and <p>speed</p> as 1. A timer count set to 1 would counter-intuitively trigger in 2 ticks time.</note><note>Timer settings are not saved in game saves.</note></description>

The next two arguments are the starting value and the finishing value. For example, if you use a start value of 1 and a finish value of 10 then the do block will run 10 times. The first time the do block runs, the counter will be 1, then it will be 2, then 3 and so on until it reaches 10, the finish value. The fourth argument of for is optional. It is the step by which the counter will change each loop. If you use a step of 2 then the counter will count 1,3,5,7,9. If you switch the start and finish values and use a step of -1 then the counter will go backwards. If you use 0 as the step, the counter will never change, so the do block will repeat forever.

<note><p>return</p> in HamsterSpeak is completely different from <p>return</p> in nearly all other programming languages!</note>
Sets the value to be returned by the script. This is only useful when the script has been called as a function from another script. It is irrelevant to scripts called directly from your RPG, for example, text box scripts or menu scripts. This command only matters when you are calling one script from another script. This command does NOT cause the script to terminate, it just sets the return value. If you never use the <p>return</p> command, the script will return zero. If return is used more than once in the same script, only the last one executed matters.
<example>
script, key wait, ticks, begin
  # Returns true if a key was pressed during the wait,
  # or false (0) if the wait finished uninterrupted.
  # The wait duration is always the same.
  variable(i)
  for(i, 1, ticks) do, begin
    wait(1)
    if(key is pressed(key:ENTER)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(key:SPACE)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(key:CTRL)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(key:ALT)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(key:ESC)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(joy:button 1)) then(return(true))
    if(key is pressed(joy:button 2)) then(return(true))

			<description>When used inside the <ref>do</ref> block of a <ref>for</ref> or <ref>while</ref> command, <p>continue</p> skips the rest of the do block and continues on to the next loop.

			<canon>switch(expression)</canon>
			<shortname>switch</shortname>
			<added>ubersetzung</added>
			<description>Select between a number of <ref>case</ref> blocks to execute based on the value of an expression. The switch command is an alternative to a big block of nested <ref>if</ref>/then/else commands that all check the same value. Switch can be easier to read than a lot of if's. Consider the follow script snippet:
<example>if (v == 0) then (
  something
) else if (v == 1 || v == 2) then (
  something else
) else if (v == 3 || v == 4) then (
  yet another thing
) else if (v == 10) then (
  #nothing happens here
) else (
  something to do if none of the other ifs are true
)</example>
This is a good candidate for using switch. The example below shows how this can be done:
<example>switch(v) do(
  case(0) do(
    something
  )
  case(1, 2) do(  # A case can contain multiple values...
    something else
  )
  case(3)
  case(4) do(  # ...or you can use multiple cases after another
    yet another thing
  )
  case(10) do()  #nothing happens here
  else(
    something to do if none of the cases happen
  )
)</example>
The <p>else</p> section is optional.
There are two different styles (syntaxes) in which switch can be written. The second style looks like this (completely equivalent to the above example):
<example>switch(v) do(
  case(0)    something
  case(1, 2) something else
  case(3)    
  case(4)    yet another thing
  case(10)   do() #nothing happens here
  case(else) something to do if none of the cases happen
)</example>
Besides readability, there is one other important difference between using switch and using a sequence of if's. The switch command only checks the value of the expression (v) once. The if/then/else method checks v repeatedly, so it could be slower, and could be susceptible to errors if you accidentally change the value of v somewhere in the middle.

			<canon>load map state (whichdata, customid)</canon>
			<shortname>load map state</shortname>
			<description>Load temporary map state data previously saved either by <ref>savemapstate</ref> or when leaving a map set to remember state. The two arguments are optional and for advanced use. <p>whichdata</p> is a set of bits in the <ref>savemapstate</ref> format to determine what exactly to load. The default is mapstate:all. <p>customid</p> is a number between 0 and 31 of a slot in which a custom save was made. Data from a different map can be loaded, but only tile data from a map of the same size! If you attempt to load state data which has not been saved then it will be loaded from the game files instead, unless you are using <p>customid</p>, in which case nothing will be loaded.</description>

			<description>Reloads original unaltered map data from the RPG file. <p>whichdata</p> is a set of bits in the <ref>savemapstate</ref> format to determine what exactly to load. It is optional and the default is mapstate:all. This does not remove temp state files for the map, so they could still be loaded instead when you next enter the map, use <ref>deletemapstate</ref> to remove them if wanted.</description>

			<shortname>delete map state</shortname>
			<description>Deletes temporary map state files for the current map, so that if the map is set to load NPC or tile data it will load the original data from the game files when it is entered. <p>whichdata</p> is a set of bits in the <ref>savemapstate</ref> format to determine what exactly to delete. The default is mapstate:all.</description>

		<command id="gettileanimationoffset">
			<canon>get tile animation offset (animation pattern, layer)</canon>
			<shortname>get tile animation offset</shortname>
			<description>Returns the offset from the starting tile that the <p>animation pattern</p> (either 0 or 1) of the tileset in use by the <p>layer</p> (0 to 2) is currently at. For example, if the pattern has stepped 1 to the right, the offset is 1, if it has moved down 2 and 1 to the left, it is 31 (2 * 16 - 1). Because different layers can have different tilesets, you might need to specify the layer with the tileset to examine; otherwise layer 0 is assumed.<note>Layers that use the same tileset do NOT have different copies of the tileset. Layers with the same tileset will always have the same tile animation offsets.</note></description>

			<description>Sets the offset from the starting tile that an <p>animation pattern</p> (either 0 or 1) of a tileset in use by a <p>layer</p> (0 to 2) is currently at. If there is a pattern defined, it will continue to step left, right, up and down from the offset you give it, until the end of the animation is reached, when the offset is reset to 0. Because different layers can have different tilesets, you might need to specify the layer with the tileset to examine; otherwise layer 0 is assumed. <note>Layers that use the same tileset do NOT have different copies of the tileset. Layers with the same tileset will always have the same tile animation offsets, you can not change them independently.</note></description>
