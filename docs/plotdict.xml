DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS XML FILE:

This markup (hereby refered to as PDL (Plotscript Dictionary Language)) is
designed to reduce the time spent maintaining the Plotscripting Dictionary, and
to enable easier porting to other formats.

The root element is the <plotscript> element. It has a lastmodified attribute,
which is the text date that the file was last modified. Update this when you
make a change.

In <plotscript>, there is a series of <section> elements, each with a title
attribute. These are to group the plotscripting commands into logical groups,
such as <section title="Wait Commands"> or <section title="Math Operators">

The heart of the PDL are the <command> elements inside the <section>s. It has a
single attribute, id. This is essentially the whitespace stripped version of the
command (the "wait for text box" command would have an id of "waitfortextbox").
This is used to uniquely identify each command. It's used in many ways, from
crosslinking command entries to generating a file for HssEd to use.

Inside the <command> element are either two or four+ elements, in this order:
Case 1: Full command definition
  <cannon> - This is the "cannonical" form of the command: the fully spaced
  			 command with parameter prototypes. Example: move hero to x (who, x)
  <shortname> - This is the short version of the command, used for crosslinking,
  				indexes, etc. It is the <cannon> element, minus the parameters.
  				Example: move hero to x
  <description> - This is a paragraph (or more) of text describing what the
  				  command does, and how to use it. Use <lb/> to put paragraphs
  				  in, and <p></p> when refering to a parameter (to avoid user
  				  confusion) No HTML is allowed (at this time) Example: Well, it
  				  would be pretty long...
  <example>* - Finally, most commands should have some sort of example on how to
  			   use the command. It will be displayed in a mono-space font, so
  			   it's easy to Plotscript. But, be sure to format it properly:
			   Example:
			   <example># first example line has no line-break
# the second (and more) lines should have no indentation
# and so forth</example>

Case 2: Alias command definition
  <alias> - If a command is an alias to another command (or is so closely
  			related that they're in the same entry, use the <alias> element. Put
  			the ID of the real command in here. Example: begin
  <shortname> - Aliases also need a short name, since they are technically
  				different from their alias. Example: end

Basically, you should be able to examine the entries that already exist. It's
fairly self evident what everything does.

These are cut-and-paste copies of <command> elements, so you don't have to type
everything out 10000000000 times. They are also indented properly for this file.

Which reminds me: Indentation. For each "level" you go down in the heirarchy,
you indent once. Many code specific editors will maintain this indentation level
for until you explicitly change it, so it isn't difficult. Notepad users will
have to do it manually, but you MUST do it. Remember: 1 indent = 1 tab.

	<section title="Declarations">
		<command id="definescript">
			<cannon>define script (id,name,arguments)</cannon>
			<shortname>define script</shortname>
			<description>The define script command names a script, and associates it with an ID number. Every script must have a unique ID number for your game to call it directly (scripts that will only be called indirectly, by other scripts can use the special ID autonumber). The first argument is the <p>ID number</p>. It is a number between 1 and 16383. If you try to give two individual scripts the same <p>ID number</p>, your script file will not compile. The next argument is the <p>name</p> of the script. this is the same name that will used later in your script command. The third argument is the number of arguments that the script can accept. If it doesnt need any arguments (most scripts dont) then use <ref>none</ref>. If there are arguments, you then follow the argument count with default values for each argument.</description>
			<example># example of a simple script definition
define script (1,my first script,none)</example>
			<example># example of a script definition with arguments. this script
# has three arguments, all of which default to zero if they
# are not specified
define script (2,my fancy script,3,0,0,0)</example>
		</command>
		<command id="script">
			<cannon>script, name, argumentnames (statements)</cannon>
			<shortname>script</shortname>
			<description>The script command contains the actual source code of a plotscript. every script command must have a corresponding <ref>definescript</ref> statement. Script starts with the keyword script, a comma, and then the name of the script. If there are any arguments to the script, you list their names separated by commas after the name of the script. Then comes the text of the script. It is usually enclosed in <ref>begin</ref> and <ref>end</ref> statements.</description>
			<example># example of a simple script
script,my first script,begin
	# commands go here
end</example>
			<example># example of a script with arguments
script,my fancy script,fe,fi,fo,begin
	# commands go here,
	# and they can use the aruments fe, fi, and fo
	# that where passed to the script
end</example>
		</command>
		<command id="globalvariable">
			<cannon>global variable (id,name)</cannon>
			<shortname>global variable</shortname>
			<description>Creates a global variable that can be used in any script. The first argument to the global variable declaration is a unique ID number. The second argument is the name of the variable. The ID number for a global variable is a number from 0 to 1024. Each global variable must have a unique number, but this number will not conflict with the ID numbers you use for scripts. It is all right to have a script and a global variable with the same ID number. See also <ref>variable</ref></description>
			<example># any script can read and set the value of a global
global variable(1,mini game score)</example>
		</command>
		<command id="variable">
			<cannon>variable (name)</cannon>
			<shortname>variable</shortname>
			<description>Creates a local variable that can only be used inside the script where it was created. The value of this variable is lost when the script ends. If you need a variable who&apos;s value persists between calls to a script, or that is automatically saved when the player saves their game, you will need to use a <ref>globalvariable</ref> instead.</description>
			<example>variable(points) # make a new variable
variable+=1 # add one to it</example>
		</command>
		<command id="defineconstant">
			<cannon>define constant (number,name)</cannon>
			<shortname>define constant</shortname>
			<description>Creates a global constant. The first argument is the number that the constant will represent, and the second argument is the name of the constant. Use constants to replace commonly used numbers with friendly names. The following constants have been delacred for you in PLOTSRC.HSD:<lb /><ref>zero</ref> <ref>one</ref> <ref>two</ref> <ref>three</ref> <ref>four</ref> <ref>five</ref> <ref>six</ref> <ref>seven</ref> <ref>eight</ref> <ref>nine</ref> <ref>ten</ref> <ref>false</ref> <ref>true</ref> <ref>off</ref> <ref>on</ref> <ref>north</ref> <ref>east</ref> <ref>south</ref> <ref>west</ref> <ref>up</ref> <ref>down</ref> <ref>left</ref> <ref>right</ref> <ref>upkey</ref> <ref>downkey</ref> <ref>leftkey</ref> <ref>rightkey</ref> <ref>usekey</ref> <ref>cancelkey</ref> <ref>menukey</ref> <ref>anykey</ref> <ref>me</ref> <ref>none</ref> <ref>autonumber</ref> <ref>currentstat</ref> <ref>maximumstat</ref> <ref>northwall</ref> <ref>eastwall</ref> <ref>southwall</ref> <ref>westwall</ref> <ref>vehiclea</ref> <ref>vehiclea</ref> <ref>harmtile</ref> <ref>overheadtile</ref></description>
		</command>
		<command id="include">
			<cannon>include, filename</cannon>
			<shortname>include</shortname>
			<description>The include command inserts another text file into your script. It is followed by a single filename that tells what file will be included. Windows long filenames are not supported. Every plotscript file should start with include, plotscr.hsd The PLOTSCR.HSD file contains definitions and constants for most of the other plotscripting commands.</description>

			<cannon>NPC reference (ID,copy)</cannon>
			<shortname>NPC reference</shortname>
			<description>What is an NPC reference? A reference is a number that uniquely identifies an NPC on a map. You can use an NPC reference to specify which NPC you are controlling in most NPC-related commands. The first argument to NPC reference is the ID number of the NPC you want to work with. The ID is the same number that appears in CUSTOM.EXE when you are editing NPCs or placing NPCs on the map. The second argument is optional. It specifies which copy of the NPC you want, in case there are more than one on the map. If you dont specify which copy you want, you will just get a reference to the first NPC on the map with the right ID. If you plan on using the same NPC reference many times in a script you can store it in a <ref>variable</ref>. If the NPC with the ID you asked for (or the NPC copy you asked for with ID you asked for) is not found on the map then NPC reference will return <ref>false</ref>.</description>
			<example>include,plotscr.hsd
define script(1,ref example,none)

#---NPC reference example---

script,ref example,begin

  variable(Fred)

  # find the first copy of NPC 10,
  # and store the reference in a variable
  set variable(Fred,NPC reference(10,0))

  # now we can manipulate that NPC with the variable
  walk NPC     (Fred,south,3)
  wait for NPC (Fred)

  # make the NPC spin!
  set NPC direction (Fred,east)
  wait(2)
  set NPC direction (Fred,north)
  wait(2)
  set NPC direction (Fred,west)
  wait(2)
  set NPC direction (Fred,south)
  wait(2)

		<command id="npcatspot">
			<cannon>NPC at spot (x,y,number)</cannon>
			<shortname>NPC at spot</shortname>
			<description>This command returns a reference to the NPC at the given X and Y coordinate on the map. The optional third argument lets you choose which NPC to reference in case there is more than one NPC standing on that same spot (starting from the bottom most NPC, which is number 0). You can also pass the constant <ref>getcount</ref> for the third argument to return the total number of npcs on that tile. <note>An NPC's tile is the tile its top left corner is on.</note></description>

You can use an <ref>npcreference</ref> or the NPC&apos;s ID number. The second argument is the direction. Use the constants: <ref>north</ref>, <ref>south</ref>, <ref>east</ref>, <ref>west</ref>, <ref>up</ref>, <ref>down</ref>, <ref>left</ref>, or <ref>right</ref>. The third argument is the number of tiles to move. If you leave out the third argument, the NPC will move one tile. walk NPC is usually used with the <ref>waitfornpc</ref> command. You should normally use the <ref>suspendnpcs</ref> command before moving NPCs to prevent their automatic movements from interfering with your scripted movements.</description>
		</command>
		<command id="setnpcdirection">
			<cannon>set NPC direction (who,direction)</cannon>
			<shortname>set NPC direction</shortname>

			<description>Changes the walking speed of the specified NPC. If you do not specify a speed, the NPC&apos;s speed will return to the default, 4. Be careful with using speeds that do not divide evenly into 20, because tiles are 20 pixels in size, and an irregular walking speed may cause the NPC to become misaligned with the tiles.<lb/>Normally you would only give an NPC ID number to set NPC speed, but if you want to use an <ref>npcreference</ref> it will still work. Just remember that set NPC speed changes every copy of the NPC on the map, not just the specific one you referenced.</description>

Since plotscripting can't handle decimals, this position must be multiplied and rounded off until it is within plotscripting's capabilities. By default, it is 100 (so it will return -100 - 100). <p>joystick</p> can be from 0-3. Most of the time, you will want to use joystick #0, so that is what <p>joystick</p> defaults to.</description>

<p>trigger</p> is what happens when the timer runs out. You can use the constant <ref>timer:gameover</ref> to indicate that the game should end, or specify a plotscript (in the form "@my script") to have that run.<lb/>
By default, a timer will not show up on screen. However, you can bind a timer to a string using the <p>string</p> parameter. Pass it the id of a string, and that string will be updated every time the timer counts down. You are responsible for displaying and positioning the string.<lb/>
A timer also has a few other options in the form of <p>flags</p>.

			<description>The for command runs the commands in the do block a specified number of times. The first argument to for is the counter. It must be a variable. The next two arguments are the starting value and the finishing value. For example, if you use a start value of 1 and a finish value of 10 then the do block will run 10 times. The first time the do block runs, the counter will be 1, then it will be 2, then 3 and so on until it reaches 10, the finish value. The fourth argument of for is optional. It is the step by which the counter will change each loop. If you use a step of 2 then the counter will count 1,3,5,7,9. If you switch the start and finish values and use a step of -1 then the counter will go backwards. If you use 0 as the step, the counter will never change, so the do block will repeat forever.

			<description>Load temporary map state data previously saved either by <ref>savemapstate</ref> or when leaving a map set to remember state. The two arguments are optional and for advanced use. <p>whichdata</p> is a set of bits in the <ref>savemapstate</ref> format to determine what exactly to load. The default is mapstate:all. <p>customid</p> is a number between 0 and 31 of a slot in which a custom save was made. Data from a different map can be loaded, but only tile data from a map of the same size! If you attempt to load state data which has not been saved then it will be loaded from the game files instead, unless you are using <p>customid</p>, in which case nothing will be loaded.</description>
