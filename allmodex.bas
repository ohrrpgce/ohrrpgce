'Arguments:
'
'Pass in a reference to a (fresh!!) PrintStrState object with .thefont and .fgcolor set
'.fgcolor can be -1 for no colour (just use font palette).
'.not_transparent and .bgcolor (only used if .not_transparent) may also be set
'
'At least one of <s>pal and</s> the (current) font pal and .fgcolor must be not NULL/-1.
'This can be ensured by starting with either a palette or a .fgcolor!=-1
'FIXME: pal is currently disabled; palette handling needs rewriting.
'
'endchar shouldn't be used; currently broken?
'
'If withtags is false then no tags are processed.
'If withtags is true, the follow "basic texttags" are processed:
'  (These will change!)
'-${F#}  changes to font # or return to initial font if # == -1
'-${K#}  changes foreground/first colour, or return to initial colour if # == -1
'        (Note that this does disable the foreground colour, unless the initial fg colour was -1!)
'-${KB#} changes the background colour, and turns on not_transparent.
'        Specify -1 to restore previous background colour and transparency
'        FIXME: ${KB0} does NOT switch to transparency, but an initial bgcol of 0 IS transparent!
'-${KP#} changes to palette # (-1 is invalid) (Maybe should make ${F-1} return to the default)
'        (Note, palette changes are per-font, and expire when the font changes)
'-${LM#} sets left margin for the current line, in pixels
'-${RM#} sets right margin for the current line, in pixels
'Purposefully no way to set background colour.
'Unrecognised and invalid basic texttags are printed as normal.
'ASCII character 8 can be used to hide texttags by overwriting the $, like so: \008{X#}
'
'Clipping and wrapping:
'If you specify a page width (the default is "infinite"), then text automatically wraps according
'to current margins. Otherwise there is no limit on the right (not even the edge of the screen).
'xpos is the left limit, and xpos+wide is the right limit from which margins are measured (inwards).
'Drawn text is NOT clipped to this region, use setclip or frame_new_view for that.
'This region may be larger than the clip area.
'If withnewlines is true, then newlines (ASCII character 10) are respected
'instead of printed as normal characters.
'
'If you want to skip some number of lines, you should clip, and draw some number of pixels
'above the clipping rectangle.
