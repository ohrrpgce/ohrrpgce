8/27/16
v1.20

-Fix bug 2006: major slowdown after switching to another program while a joystick is plugged in

--------------------------------------------------
6/5/16
v1.19

-New io_setmousevisibility and rewritten cursor visibility handling
-A few other undocumented changes over the last years

--------------------------------------------------
6/6/12
v1.18

-Fixed bug 956: on some computers, graphics mangled on startup until the window is resized
 (Was fixed earlier, but version number not bumped)




--------------------------------------------------
3/2/12
v1.17

Added Features:

-Support for native (keyboard layout respecting) unicode text input (io_textinput)

-Support for gfx_getwindowstate, which allows the engine to ignore WM combinations




--------------------------------------------------
5/1/11
v1.16

Added Features:

-Fixed graphical bug where switching Aspect Ratio Preservation off then on would leave garbage on the sides.

-Fixed mouse bug where clicking a border to resize or move would cause mouse input to enter dead state.




--------------------------------------------------
4/30/11
v1.15

Added Features:

-Fixed hiding the taskbar in fullscreen mode.

-Provided for alt-tabbing mechanism in fullscreen.

-Fixed mouse movement from io_setmouse(). When in tile editor, pressing the directional keys on the keyboard caused the mouse cursor to move to strange locations. This is fixed.

-May have fixed the delay bug caused by switching to another window. (It was joystick related... of all things...)




--------------------------------------------------
4/28/11
v1.14

Added Features:

-Now more information is reported in the debug texts for initialization.

-Fixed a potential crash.

-Expanded compatibility.

-Fixed PrintScreen button.

-If Vista/7 users pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del, the program could crash. This was fixed.




--------------------------------------------------
4/27/11
v1.13

Added Features:

-Added method to disable system messages in Options Dialog (Alt key combinations). Alt-Tab still hasn't been stopped, though.

-Added Joystick Config button, but it's disabled for now.

-Keyboard and mouse are cleared of their state (except toggle keys) upon leaving the window.

-DirectX no longer manages the window. On Vista/7, entering full screen mode then exiting would force the colors to become "basic" until the app finished. No longer.

-Extended compatibility for directx hardware incapable of running hardware vertex processing.




--------------------------------------------------
4/23/11
v1.12

Added Features:

-All keys now report correctly, including extended keys and toggle keys. NumLock is no longer required for the NumPad keys to work correctly.




--------------------------------------------------
4/19/11
v1.11

Added Features:

-Support for new scancodes (distinguishable numpad keys)

-Fixed fast keypresses being lost, by switching to io_keybits




--------------------------------------------------
10/27/10
v1.10

Added Features:

-Fixed cursor clipping (specifically, right and bottom sides of client window).

-Changed window background color to black (for real this time) on startup.

-Fixed "Set Defaults" button in Options dialog to set the default screenshot format to png.

-Fixed an issue where, upon opening a game that restricts mouse movement, then pressing Scroll Lock to release the mouse, resizing the window would cause the window to shrink or expand dramatically.




--------------------------------------------------
10/7/10
v1.9

Added Features:

-Updated backend control functions (programming side) to new proposed interfaces.

-Added a "Refresh Joysticks - Count: x" button in the Options dialog. If a joystick is unplugged or plugged in while running, pressing the refresh will update the state. It also reports how many joysticks are plugged in.

-Fixed left and right shift keypress registration

-Changed window background color to black on startup

-Default screenshot format is png.

-Mapped the "Break/Pause" button to NumLock. One can now pause the game using "Break/Pause" or NumLock.

-Fixed ScrollLock-then-fullscreen bug.

-Fixed other mouse issues while in fullscreen and windowed, including clipping and cursor visibility handling.

-Fixed bug from entering fullscreen while window was maximized.

-Added support for io_mouserect(), or gfx_ClipCursor(). Games that used this functionality are now supported.

-While in windowed mode, if the mouse moves to the non-client area of the window (ie. close button, options menu), the cursor position is not updated in the engine, but the user can resize, select options, minimize, maximize, and close.

-When the cursor is being clipped to the window (restricted movement to the window), the user may press ScrollLock to free the mouse. This is pretty much the same functionality as before, except the user need not use ScrollLock to select options, etc. any longer.

-The ohr cursor position appears much closer to the actual location of the mouse messages it expects. (1 pixel artifact in both x and y!)

-Fixed potential crash issues.




--------------------------------------------------
9/26/10
v1.8
(Somehow information on v1.7 was lost in the development...)

Added Features:

-Fixed window icon to appear as the custom or game icon.

-Help file added to options menu.

-Fixed problem where frame would show garbage initially.

-No longer see the resizing of the window upon initialization.

-Mouse and keyboard are now through window's messages, no longer through DirectInput.

-DirectInput is not required for usage--however, if present, an infinite set of joysticks can be used with the ohr engine.

-Mouse is positioned in the window according to where the window mouse really is.

-Mouse is restricted to window if a button is being held down, but not otherwise.

-Fixed problem where system cursor could show up while not capturing mouse input and in fullscreen.




--------------------------------------------------
12/31/09
v1.6

Added Features:

-Made options in the Options dialog immediately affect the game/custom window. If cancel is pressed, the options are reverted.




--------------------------------------------------
12/29/09-12/31/09
v1.5

Added Features:

-Fixed a graphical bug on text boxes

-Support for the both versions of backend interfaces: the current 1.0, and the next generation 2.0.

-Help file added.

-Lots of code cleanup.




--------------------------------------------------
12/28/09
v1.4

Added Features:

-Fixed a bug when the backend failed to initialize.

-Screenshot options are disabled if the d3dx9 library to load the screen shot function fails. This means the user does not need the d3dx9 libraries at all to run the directx backend.

-Preparing modules to not be dependent on dinput8.dll being present on system.

-Some code cleanup.

Feature Request:

-Joystick support

-Revised backend interfaces




--------------------------------------------------
12/26/09
v1.3

Added Features:

-Fixed a backend silent failure bug that left a window around.

-Fixed some other minor bugs.

-Code cleanup. Removed a lot of old code used for shaders, fps display.

-Fps display has been removed. The engine can already display that statistic.

-Native resolution multiples can be acheived by dragging the corners of the windows. The window will snap to the closest native resolution.

-The backend now tests to see whether d3d9.dll and d3dx9_24.dll are present on the system, then only loads the functions (only 2) necessary to run. This allows a drammatically reduced size while maintaining _lots_ of compatibility (it's the next best thing to statically linked d3dx lib.) If the dll's are present, it uses them. Otherwise, it reports to the engine failure at initialization without crashing.

-By moving to StretchRect() instead of using shaders, the texel-pixel distortion issue that wan't going to be fixed was resolved. The picture is now pure.

Feature Request:

-Joystick support

-Continuing to revise the backend interfaces




--------------------------------------------------
12/21/09
v1.2

Added Features:

-Fixed a few more bugs

-Code cleanup

-Window title now alerts user when they can lock/free the mouse if the mouse is acquired by ohr

-All binaries released from this point will be default msvc static, d3dx dynamic, which is designated by x.y.1.

-The backend is now added to the ohr repository!

Feature Request:

-"Snap to Native Resolution" button

-Joystick support

-Rewrite backend interfaces (code side)




--------------------------------------------------
12/18/09
v1.1

Added Features:

-Fixed a few bugs

-Changed the dialog box to modeless so that the engine doesn't hang while Options are being set

-Added ability to use Scroll Lock to toggle the os mouse cursor being tied to the window. Useful if the ohr engine requests use of its own cursor and disables the os mouse cursor, and you want your os mouse cursor back.

-Adjusted initialization routines slightly

-The msvc static, d3dx dynamic build has been chosen as the default build type, so v1.1.1 is the official dll.

Feature Request:

-"Snap to Native Resolution" button

-Joystick support




--------------------------------------------------
12/17/09
v1.0
aka Beta + 1
Official public release... ;)

Added Features:

-Switching version nomenclature to Major.Minor.BuildInfo--Major releases are not compatible with each other. Minor releases are bugfixes or feature request implementations that can be solved by just recopying the dll to the folder. BuildInfo identifies whether the dll was compiled dynamically or statically: Bit 0 on identifies directx library was linked dynamically, Bit 1 on identifies msvc 2008 was linked dynamically. (ie. Version 1.0.0 means major release 1, revision 0, and statically linked d3dx lib and msvc 2008 runtime. Version 1.0.3 means major release 1, revision 0, and dynamically linked d3dx lib and msvc 2008 runtime.)

-Enabled visual themes for Options dialog so dialog appears like a modern window gui

-Added a mouse input rectangle clip that doesn't affect the os mouse

-os mouse hides when ohr mouse is active now

-Removed shader support entirely--no benefit in this situation to using shaders over IDirect3DDevice9::StretchRect()

-Multiple binary options for directx/msvc dependency issues. The dll's are interchangeable after the program is built with any of the lib files.

-Integration with runtime graphics loading

Known Bugs:

-None

Feature Request:

-"Snap to Native Resolution multiple" button

-Joystick support
